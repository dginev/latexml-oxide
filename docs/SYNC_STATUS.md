## Current status

- `cargo test --tests`: **1466 / 0 / 0**.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: **clean**.
- `--init=plain.tex` / `--init=latex.ltx`: **0 errors** (with dump and `LATEXML_NODUMP=1`).
- Distribution build (`maxperf`): ~45 MB; beats 2× pdflatex on the mini-benchmark.

## Methodology & the cortex cross-join

Working method (2026-06): **re-triage LARGE-error papers** (the single-error tail
is exhausted) → bisect the doc to the trigger line → verify Perl with `--verbose`
→ fix the divergence. Random sweeps are low-yield.

**Cortex agentic API (reads open, no token):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
Recipe: `GET /api/reports/<corpus>/oxidized-tex-to-html/<severity>` → categories;
`…/<severity>/<category>` → per-`what`; `…/<category>/<what>` → paper list. Then
`GET /api/corpus/<corpus>/tex_to_html/document/<id>` for Perl status — a Rust-only
win is **Perl=no_problem/warning but Rust=error/fatal**. Corpus
`sandbox-arxiv-10k-shuffle`. URL-encode `\`→`%5C`, `^`→`%5E`.

**State of the autonomous methods (2026-06-21) — all tapered; a FRESH cortex
rerun is the clear next step:**
- *Stale 10k error cross-join*: **mined out** — every remaining apparent
  "Rust-only" cluster traced to a SHARED cause (third-party class/pkg neither
  engine binds; author errors; stale pre-fix run). **2026-06-21 re-check via the
  live cortex `document/<id>` API (not the stale ad-hoc join):** the last two
  candidates were BOTH phantom — `1308.2655` "Extra alignment tab" on
  `\lefteqn`/`\multicolumn{N>cols}` is **parity** (Perl 1 error, Rust 1 error —
  Perl's `nextColumn` errors on column overflow too, `Alignment.pm:136-144`); and
  `0710.5692` `equationgroup isn't allowed in <ltx:p>` is **parity** (Perl 2,
  Rust 2). An ad-hoc same-tree cross-join had falsely reported both as "Perl 0";
  the stable cortex DB is authoritative. **Lesson: confirm every cross-join
  "Rust-only" read against the live cortex `document/<id>` API before chasing —
  do not trust a bespoke join's Perl column.** (One genuine *minor* residual on
  `0710.5692`: Rust reports the equationgroup location as `Anonymous String` vs
  Perl's `cosmo_sing_iwa.tex; line 1124` — a source-locator gap, belongs to the
  #47/#92 source-map track, NOT a parity/correctness bug.)
- *Diagnostic-message faithfulness*: **exhausted** — a systematic batch
  comparison (undefined CS/env, missing-number, group/mode close, malformed,
  close-environment) shows all primary messages matching Perl.
- *Structural-skeleton diff on Perl-clean papers* (the silent-divergence method
  that found the REVTeX/OmniBus `\references` fix): now consistently surfaces
  only the DEFERRED families — MathFork/content-MathML (`equation > tags`) and
  document-builder block/paragraph auto-wrap — plus cosmetic/niche cases.
- *Binding-completeness set-diff*: too noisy to be useful — it misses every
  macro defined via `TeX!(r"…")` raw-TeX blocks (single-backslash), so its
  flagged "gaps" are mostly false positives (verified: longtable `\LTcapwidth`
  etc. ARE defined). OmniBus was confirmed structurally complete this way.

**NEXT: a FRESH cortex Rust rerun built from this branch** (needs
`X-Cortex-Token`) is the prerequisite for mining genuine Rust-only *correctness*
wins now that the diagnostic messages are faithful; always re-confirm a flagged
paper on the CURRENT binary before chasing it. Otherwise, the highest-value work
is the DEFERRED focused sessions below (content-MathML, document-builder).

> **2026-06-21 update — reruns IN PROGRESS, first cortex cross-check done.** A
> fresh Rust rerun (`019eea79…`) AND a fresh Perl rerun (started 03:51) are both

>   warnings** — matching Perl. An intervening branch commit (after the rerun
>   snapshot) resolved the eqnarray/MathFork `findnodes` invalid-context failure.
>   **Lesson reaffirmed: always re-confirm a flagged paper on the CURRENT binary
>   before chasing.** Landed regardless: `xml.rs` `findnodes`/`findvalues` now
>   include the failing XPath string + context-node presence in the error (the
>   old message was just `{:?}` → empty `()`), so any future xpath failure is
>   diagnosable.
> - `0803.1344` (document/open_element_internal): Perl `fatal` vs Rust `error` →

## Math-parser / content-MathML gaps — DEFERRED to a dedicated session

> **User directive 2026-06-20: defer ALL content-MathML items to a dedicated
> session** (the math parser is a full Marpa-vs-RecDescent rewrite; these touch
> the parse-tree / content-MathML structure and want a focused regression
> budget). Notes kept here; do NOT pick at them piecemeal.

- **`f(a,b)` multi-arg flattening — FIXED 2026-06-22.** A KNOWN function applied
  to a paren comma-list now flattens: `\max(a,b)`→`maximum@(a,b)` (was
  `maximum@(vector@(a,b))`), matching Perl `ApplyDelimited`/`extract_separators`.
  Implementation was simpler than the planned grammar-rule approach: a post-parse
  spread in the `prefix_apply` ACTION (`semantics.rs`, helper `vector_tuple_items`)
  — when a function-role op (FUNCTION/OPFUNCTION/TRIGFUNCTION) applies to a
  `Dual` whose content is `Apply(vector, [refs])`, spread the items as direct
  operands instead of wrapping. No grammar/pruning change → NOT pruning-sensitive,
  zero fixture regressions. Scoped to known function roles, so unknown-`f` apply
  (`f(a,b)`→`f@(vector@(a,b))`) is untouched — the intentional divergence #18.
  Verified Perl-identical: `\max(a,b)`/`\gcd(a,b)`/`\min(x,y,z)`/`g(a,b,c)` +
  nesting/`\frac`/trailing-ops; suite 1466/0; regression test in
  `parse/functions`. (Known pre-existing aside: juxtaposed `\max(a,b)\min(c,d)`
  greedily reads `\max` over the product — a separate function-juxtaposition
  pruning issue, not this flatten.)
- **`f(x)` single-arg apply-vs-multiply** (most PERVASIVE divergence): for an
  UNKNOWN/undeclared symbol + paren arg, Rust reads *application*, Perl reads
  *multiplication* — `\Gamma(s)`→Rust `Gamma@(s)` vs Perl `Gamma * s` (likewise
  `\zeta(s)`, `\Phi(x)`, `f(x)`). A real fix must respect Perl's "only declared
  FUNCTION/known-operator names apply; bare letters multiply" rule; heavily
  pruning-sensitive.
  > **SURVEY 2026-06-22 (current-state + blast radius — groundwork, NOT yet
  > changed):** confirmed the split cleanly — KNOWN functions ALREADY match Perl
  > (`\sin(x)`/`\log(x)` → `sine@(x)`/`logarithm@(x)` in both); only UNKNOWN
  > symbols diverge (`f(x)`/`g(x)`/`P(x)`/`\Gamma(s)`/`\zeta(s)`/`\phi(x)` →
  > Rust `X@(x)` vs Perl `X * x`; `f(x+1)` → Rust `f@(x+1)` vs Perl `f * (x+1)`).
  > LEXER ROLE: unknown `f` = `role="UNKNOWN"`, `\max` = `role="OPFUNCTION"` — so
  > the apply-of-UNKNOWN (A) is separable from the known-fn flatten (B). BLAST
  > RADIUS of A is corpus-wide: 25 test fixtures, ~150 single-letter applies
  > (`f@(`×57, `d@(`×51, `g@(`×13, …) would flip to multiply — a sweeping change
  > that reshapes all math output. Because A is corpus-wide (even though
  > toward-Perl), it needs explicit scope sign-off before undertaking; B (below)
  > is the contained first step (~5 fixtures).
- **`[a|b]` / `[a \mid b]` bracket-conditional — FIXED 2026-06-22.** Was unparsed
  in Rust; now `delimited-[]@(conditional@(a,b))` matching Perl (`E[X|Y]` etc.).
  Root: the bare `a|b` conditional reduces only at statement level (not as an
  `expression`), so `[a|b]` had no fence rule — though `[(a|b)]` already worked.
  Fix: a surgical grammar rule `lbracket formula singlevertbar formula rbracket =>
  bracket_conditional` (`singlevertbar` also covers `\mid`) + a `bracket_conditional`
  action (semantics.rs) that builds the inner `conditional@(a,b)` (delimiter-less
  presentation) and wraps it in `delimited-[]` via the same `fenced` path
  `[(a|b)]` uses (ctxt reborrow for the two ref levels). Suite 1466/0, clippy
  clean, zero other-fixture changes; regression test in `parse/vertbars`. (The
  `E` in `E[X|Y]` stays `E@(…)` apply vs Perl `E * …` — divergence #18, preserved.)
- **`⁡` DecorateOperator over-insertion — FIXED 2026-06-22.** Presentation MathML
  emitted `⁡` (U+2061 FUNCTION APPLICATION) after operators that render as
  `<m:mo>` — `\nabla \phi`→`∇⁡ϕ`, `\partial f`→`∂⁡f`, and (pre-existing) `\sum_i
  a_i`→`∑⁡a_i`, `\int f`→`∫⁡f` — where Perl juxtaposes (∇ϕ/∂f/∑a/∫f). Perl's rule
  (MathML.pm `Apply:?:?`): insert `⁡` only when the op base is NOT an `<m:mo>` (a
  function identifier `f`/`\sin`/`\max` IS `<m:mi>` → keeps `⁡`). FIX
  (`latexml_post/.../presentation.rs`): new `op_base_is_mo` helper (descends
  msub/msup/munder/mover to the base); applied at the generic-apply site AND in
  `pmml_summation`; and removed `DIFFOP` from the big-op→`pmml_summation` route
  (Perl MathML.pm:702 `# Not DIFFOP`). Suite 1466/0, clippy clean; verified
  Perl-identical for ∇/∂/∑/∫/∏/⋃/lim + `\sin`/`\max`/scripted forms; only residual
  diff is the `f(x)` apply-vs-multiply (`f⁡(` vs `f⁢(`) — divergence #18,
  preserved. Regression test in `tests/post/opdecoration`.
- **wide-space PUNCT XMDual content-arm XMRef ordering**: `x^2\quad y` — the
  `\quad` (≥10pt) becomes a virtual PUNCT through `formulae_apply`, producing an
  XMDual whose content-arm XMRef siblings emit one slot off from Perl. Same
  MathFork/split content-arm xml:id family as the `expected:id` tail
  (`EXPECTED_ID_XMREF_DESIGN_2026-06-08.md`). NOT the rpadding path (thin spaces
  `\,` are Perl-faithful incl. NewScript transfer, `005716ff66`).
- **`\DeclareMathOperator` cluster — INVESTIGATED 2026-06-22, LOW-VALUE metadata,
  deprioritized** (`text=` and cMML already match): (a) Perl splits Math attrs
  `tex="\operatorname{Tr}…"` vs `content-tex="\Tr…"` (Perl defines `\Tr` *via*
  `Invocation(\operatorname,…)` + `revert_as=>'context'`); Rust defines it
  directly so `tex` keeps the user macro `\Tr` (arguably MORE source-faithful) and
  emits no `content-tex`. Matching Perl needs the deep `revert_as=>context`
  content-tex mechanism — high effort, metadata-only value. (b) The `name="Tr"`
  "gap" is NOT a bug: `def_math` (dialect.rs:1567) DOES infer `name` from the CS
  but DROPS it when `name == presentation` (line ~33) — a deliberate
  redundant-attr cleanup. `\Tr` (name "Tr" == content "Tr") drops it; `\argmax`
  (name ≠ "arg max") keeps it. Perl always emits it. Changing this touches the
  GENERAL def_math path (every math token) for cosmetic value → not worth it.
  (c) `\DeclareMathOperator*` `scriptpos` in display mode — the remaining
  candidate if revisited, but mode-dependent and niche. Whole cluster parked.
- **N-ary bare-operator listing** (content-loss already FIXED `a75fbf17ed`):
  `\[ + - \times \div \]` → Perl `list@(+,-,*,/)`; Rust now marks unparsed with
  ALL tokens preserved (the coverage guard rejects the exhausted-early prefix
  parse). Remaining = the N-ary upgrade: `anyop anyop` → recursive
  `compound_operator_2` list (its own `// TODO`). Ambiguity-sensitive. (Root
  cause was the marpa fork's `Parser::read` breaking on `is_exhausted()` before
  the token source drained — `marpa/src/parser/mod.rs:130`.)
- **comma-list LEFT of a relation `a,b \in A` — FIXED 2026-06-22 (2-item path).**
  Was the wrong `formulae@(a, b∈A)` (∈ binding only `b`). Now the user-specified
  surpass-Perl **XMDual**: content **DISTRIBUTES** — `formulae@(∈(a,A), ∈(b,A))`,
  sharing XMRefs to the relop and RHS — presentation wraps the list as the
  relation's LHS — `Apply(∈, XMWrap(a,',',b), A)`. Implemented as a scoped
  transform at the end of `formulae_apply` (semantics.rs): when `left` is a bare
  (non-relational, non-Dual) item and `right` is a binary RELOP relation
  `Apply(R,[lhs,rhs])` under a comma, `distribute_list_relation` builds the dual.
  `x,y \le z`→`formulae@(x≤z, y≤z)`. The list-RIGHT `0<x,y`→`list@(0<x,y)`,
  all-relational `a=b,c=d`→`formulae@`, and bare `a,b`→`list@` all stay. Full suite
  1466/0, clippy clean, zero other-fixture changes; regression test in
  `parse/relations`. **Remaining (follow-up):** the 3+-item `a,b,c \in S` goes
  through `list_apply` (not `formulae_apply`) → still `list@(a,b,c∈S)`; the same
  distribution needs porting to that path.
- **relation with a list-RHS that itself contains a scripted relop**:
  `a \le b \quad \stackrel{?}{\ge} \quad c` → Perl `a <= list@(b, >=^?, c)`, Rust
  unparsed. The scripted-relop atomic fix (`4a5ebf29f7`) cleared standalone list
  items but not a relop-item inside a relation's list-RHS.
- **`\underset`/`\overset` over an ARROW with a multi-token script**:
  `x \underset{n\to\infty}{\to} y` — the under-script reads `n@to@infinity`
  (apply) where Perl groups `(n to infinity)`. Same ARROW-as-applied-function
  family as `f(a,b)`.

CAUTION: new VERTBAR/fence grammar rules can collide with package-built
structures — always cross-check the affected fixture against Perl before
assuming a regression (the norm rule "regressed" physics_test, but Perl matched
the new output, so it was a parity *fix*).

## DefMathRewrite `\WildCard` subscript bug (focused-session item)

`DefMathRewrite` with a `\WildCard` SUBSCRIPT pattern doesn't demote the match
(witness `math/simplemath`): `f_\WildCard → role=ID` should make `f_1(a+b)` =
`f _ 1 * (a+b)` (Perl), but Rust produces `Unknown@() * (a + b)` — the
`f_\WildCard` rewrite isn't firing (or loses to the sibling `f → FUNCTION`
rewrite), so `f_1` stays a FUNCTION and gets APPLIED. The non-wildcard
`f_D → DIFFOP` works, so it's the `_\WildCard`-subscript match/ordering in
`latexml_package/.../latexml_sty.rs` (`compile_declare_pattern`). Niche
(binding-author feature, rare in real arXiv); the fixture encodes the buggy
output.

## Open tasks (actionable)

### 1. `ERROR_DEBT` test-gate drain
The harness error-gate (`latexml_oxide/src/util/test.rs`) fails a test at zero
debt to force removal once fixed. Remaining:
- **`figure_mixed_content`** — `ltx:theorem` not allowed in `ltx:figure` (Perl
  also errors 1). True fix = **schema expansion** (theorems/mdframed in figures).

### 2. `\gls`/`\acrshort` in MATH mode (1705.10306) — suspected Rust gap, UNVERIFIED vs Perl
293 errors `ltx:XMTok isn't allowed in <ltx:glossaryref>` (the "Perl 1" figure is
**unverifiable** — 1705.10306 is in NO cortex corpus and Perl 0.8.8 times out on
glossaries on this host, so it cannot be cross-checked; treat as suspected, not
confirmed): a glossary
command in math mode forces the `glossaryref` content (#3, the link display
text) as math → bare `<XMTok>`, which `Inline.model` rejects. **Diagnosis
re-narrowed 2026-06-21** (earlier "document-builder / Math-not-auto-openable"
theory DISPROVEN): on the SAME host tree the current binary is **byte-identical
to Perl** for `\textbf`/`\emph`/`\href` in math (general math-in-text is
faithful); `ltx:Math`/`ltx:XMath` are **not** autoOpen in either engine (so no
auto-open path), and `ltx:glossaryref` has **no** autoClose in either (faithful,
so it can't float its content out like `emph` does). Most likely root: Perl's
**raw-loaded `glossaries.sty`** typesets the term as TEXT (`\glstextformat`/
`\mbox`), so Perl's #3 is PCDATA — the Rust divergence is in the raw-load
display chain, **not** the document builder. **STILL BLOCKED** on a runnable
Perl reference: glossaries times out in Perl 0.8.8 on this host (datatool/
l3regex) even without `\makeglossaries`; the `glossary.{tex,xml}` fixture has no
math case; witness 1705.10306 is not in the local corpus. Repro + full notes:
`docs/reproducers/glossaryref_math_xmtok.tex`.

### 3. PR #248 B1 — re-entrant `&mut Document` UB (runtime-bindings), accepted caveat
The Rhai constructor trampoline re-mints `&mut Document` (Stacked/Tree-Borrows UB
under a re-entrant `\wrap{\myemph{..}}`). Consolidated to one audited
`script_bindings/mod.rs::with_doc` site + documented; the review's checked-guard
fix **deadlocks** `Document::absorb`. **Optional future work:** make re-entrancy
sound-while-succeeding (interior-mutable `Document` or a core handle around
`do_absorption`). Not a blocker; `runtime-bindings` stays on by default.

### 4. 0.7.0 release — release-prep LANDED; tag pending
Version bumped, `runtime-bindings` in the artifact, `.deb` deps, CHANGELOG/README
done. **Remaining:** tag `0.7.0` on `main` → `release.yml` runs the TL-window
`dumps` + macOS arm64 leg + publish (each first-exercised on that tag).

### 5. Post-processing logging parity for cortex workflows (LOG_BUFFER over the post phase)
**Goal:** `cortex.log` must carry BOTH core *and* post-processing
(Scan→Bibliography→CrossRef→**Graphics**→Split→MathML→XSLT) stage information,
so post-phase failures are captured and counted — not lost. Today the post phase
is **invisible** in the stored log, which violates the project's #1 signal-integrity
rule (CLAUDE.md "every `Error:`/`Fatal:` must be captured; fail-safe toward
detecting failure").

**Root cause (traced 2026-06-22).** The thread-local `LOG_BUFFER`
(`latexml_core::util::logger`, `bind_log`/`flush_log`) is bound around the **core**
conversion only. In `cortex_worker.rs::convert_archive`:
- L370 `converter.convert(...)` runs the core conversion and **flushes** the buffer
  internally (`converter.rs:167/285/443: log: self.flush_log()`), leaving
  `LOG_BUFFER = None`.
- L387 `run_post_processing(...)` then runs the post phases with the buffer
  **already taken**, so nothing they emit can land in it.
- L440 the stored log is built from `response.log` (core only) + `runtime_ms` +
  `Status:`. (Confirmed empirically: a clean `cortex.log` for a 6-EPS paper had a
  full core trace but **zero** `graphics:process`/`MathML[` lines.)

**Two emission paths in post, both currently uncaptured:**
1. Progress via `Note!` (`latexml_post/src/lib.rs:158`) → routes through the logger,
   but is dropped because `LOG_BUFFER` is unbound during post.
2. **Failures via raw `eprintln!`** in `latexml_oxide/src/post.rs`
   (L127 parse, L174 Split, **L210 per-phase `"{label} failed"` — covers Graphics**,
   L411 XSLT, L432 top-level, L476 page-write) → stderr only, never captured, and
   they do **not** increment `common::error::REPORT`, so `Status:conversion` stays
   `0`/OK on a real post failure (silent false-negative). Plus two leftover
   `eprintln!("DBG …")` debug lines in `graphics.rs:1239/1287` to drop.

**Why it matters (this session's trigger):** hep-th0101114 / astro-ph0004105 show
raw `.eps` in the deployed preview. The current binary + fleet env convert all EPS→PNG
correctly under `--standalone` (any profile — Graphics is **unconditional**,
`post.rs:288`, NOT profile-gated; the ar5iv↔generic deltas are only
`preload ar5iv.sty` / `noinvisibletimes` / `nodefaultresources`). So the deployed
records were produced under different conditions — but because the post phase is
unlogged, we **cannot tell from `cortex.log` whether Graphics ran-and-failed or never
ran**. Fixing the logging is the prerequisite for diagnosing this and any future
post-phase regression.

**LANDED 2026-06-22 (latexml_oxide binary + shared wrapper); cortex_worker
wiring deferred to the cortex-side owner.**
- New shared wrapper `latexml::post::run_post_processing_logged() -> PostOutcome
  { html, log, status_code }` (`latexml_oxide/src/post.rs`): re-binds the
  thread-local `LOG_BUFFER` (which `convert()` already flushed) around
  `run_post_processing`, then `flush_log()`s — the Rust equivalent of Perl's
  single post-`convert_post` `flush_log()`. Captures every post-phase
  `Info!`/`Warn!`/`post_error` (Graphics/MathML/XSLT), and reads the post
  status from the shared (core+post) REPORT counter.
- The `post.rs` failure `eprintln!`s are now `post_error()` (logs via
  `log::error!` + `note_status(Error)` so they land in the buffer AND bump the
  Error counter — but WITHOUT `Error!`'s too-many-errors `Fatal!`/`return`,
  which would not typecheck in `run_post_processing`'s `String` return). The
  splitnaming case is `Warn!`; the "Split into N" progress is `note_progress`.
  Removed the two `graphics.rs` DBG `eprintln!`s.
- `latexml_oxide` binary wired: `--log` and the archive-zip log now carry core
  **+** post via `latexml_post::writer::write_output_segments(&[core, "\n",
  post], dest)` — writes the (already-large) segments sequentially to avoid a
  third concatenated allocation on the conversion path (cold archive path still
  uses `assemble_conversion_log`, since `pack_archive` takes one `&str`). The
  CLI exit status already reads post-inclusive `get_status_code()`.
- **Verified:** `latexml_oxide --format=html5 --log=cortex.log --dest=test.html`
  on hep-th0101114 → `cortex.log` now contains `scan:db_status`,
  `graphics:process … 6 to process`, `math:converted`, `xslt:stylesheet`; 6
  PNGs produced; suite 1467/0; clippy clean.
- **Remaining:** `cortex_worker.rs::convert_archive` should call the same
  `run_post_processing_logged` and fold `max(core, post.status_code)` into its
  `Status:conversion` line (Perl `LaTeXML.pm` L631-634). The wrapper is ready;
  the actual cortex_worker edit + `maxperf-cortex` rebuild are owned by the
  cortex-side maintainer (per 2026-06-22 directive: leave the live fleet binary
  alone).

### 6. Graphics: never ship a raw `.eps`/`.pdf` to the web + post-orchestration audit
**Trigger:** hep-th0101114 / astro-ph0004105 showed raw `.eps` in the deployed
preview. We can never show `.eps`/`.pdf` on the web — always a web-native target
(`.png`/`.svg`). Verified the current binary converts both papers' EPS→PNG
correctly (6/16 PNGs), so the symptom was a *failed* conversion shipping the raw
source (now also visible via task 5's logging).

**LANDED 2026-06-22 (`latexml_post/src/graphics.rs`).** THREE guards so a raw
non-web-native source can never reach the web:
1. **Conversion-failure fallback** (was: `Error!` then `copy_to_destination` of
   the raw source → `imagesrc="fig.eps"`). Perl L324-329 does `Error`/`Warn` +
   `return` with NO imagesrc. Now matches: emit the `imageprocessing` Error and
   leave `imagesrc` unset.
2. **`Plan::NotFound`** (was: `set_attribute("imagesrc", graphic)` → raw path for
   a missing file). Perl L216-219 `Warn`s + `return` without imagesrc. Now Warn
   only.
3. **Plan routing default** (surpass-Perl): a source type with no explicit
   `destination_type` now defaults to a WEB-NATIVE target — kept as-is for
   web-native (svg/png/gif/jpg/jpeg), else `png`. Closes the hole where the
   unmapped `.postscript` graphics_type (or any future addition) fell to
   `dest_type == src_ext` → `Plan::Copy` (raw copy). Perl defaults dest_type to
   srctype (Graphics.pm:244) and would copy such a source raw; we diverge so
   non-web-native always routes through `Plan::Convert`.
- All three rely on the HTML5 XSLT (`LaTeXML-misc-xhtml.xsl:154`): a `<graphics>`
  lacking `@imagesrc` renders as `class="ltx_missing ltx_missing_image"` (empty
  src) — the correct "couldn't render" marker, never a broken `<img src=".eps">`.
- **Witness verification (latexml_oxide --format=html5 --log --dest):**
  hep-th0101114 → 6/6 `.eps`→PNG; astro-ph0004105 → 15/15 `.eps`→PNG; both with
  ZERO raw `.eps`/`.pdf`/`.ps` srcs, ZERO `ltx_missing_image`, ZERO
  `imageprocessing` errors. Suite 1467/0; clippy clean. **The `.eps`→web-image
  conversion is confirmed working for both witnesses with the current binary —
  the deployed preview's raw `.eps` was a previously-invisible failed conversion
  / stale record, now both guarded against AND logged (task 5).**

**Post-orchestration audit vs Perl `LaTeXML.pm::convert_post` + `Config.pm`
(integrated path — the one cortex uses, NOT `bin/latexmlpost`).** Our
`run_post_processing` order — Split → Scan → MakeIndex → MakeBibliography →
CrossRef → Graphics → {pmml/cmml} → XSLT — **matches** Perl's `@procs` order,
and our always-on phases are equivalent to Perl's `if <option>` gates at their
`Config.pm` defaults (`scan`/`index`/`crossref`/`dographics`/`numbersections`
all default 1; `pmml` auto-added for html/xhtml/jats). **Faithful for the
`ltx:graphics`/EPS path.** Known deltas (separate, broader parity — NOT blocking
the EPS task; candidates for future work):
- **`PictureImages` processor is absent.** Perl always pushes it (full if
  `picimages`, else `empty_only=>1`); Rust handles `<ltx:picture>` via the
  regex `extract_svg_fragments` + HTML5 inline-SVG injection instead.
- **`SVG` is a regex extractor, not a `LaTeXML::Post::SVG` processor** (intentional
  divergence; functional for HTML5 inline SVG).
- **No `prescan` mode** (Perl gates most procs on `!prescan`; rare multi-pass
  DB-build path, unused by cortex/CLI).
- **Graphics is unconditional** in Rust vs Perl's `dographics` (which Config.pm
  only defaults to 1 when a destination/archive exists) — so Rust attempts
  graphics even for stdout output. Harmless for web (always has a destination);
  matches Perl whenever a destination is set.

## Deep deferred families (parked — large or shared; dedicated sessions)

- **1610.00974 step-3** — port the *global* `p{}` column to the Perl VBox form
  (`\lx@tabular@p`/VBoxContents). The narrow `\multicolumn{}{p{}}` case is fixed;
  the global port exposes a `\cr`-mid-VBoxContents-predigest interleaving + a
  span/sizing bug on `\multicolumn` over p-columns. Also explains the p-column
  `td align="justify"` + width-on-`<p>` divergence (Perl: `align="left"` +
  width-on-`<inline-block>`). Surpass-Perl R&D. **Related residuals catalogued
  with minimal reproducers in `docs/reproducers/array_pcolumn/`** (Kind B: `>{}`
  prefix align not on `<td>`; Kind C/D: regular `m{}`/`b{}` use a plain
  `\vtop{}`/`\vbox{}` not the `\lx@tabular@p` VBox → width-on-`<td>` + inline-block
  `vattach`/width drift). The `\multicolumn`-over-`m{}`/`b{}` GROUP ERROR in that
  family is now **FIXED** (was 1805.01525 27→0; `tex_tables.rs`
  `\lx@alignment@multicolumn` generalized from p{}-only to all paragraph columns).
- **`expected:id` cmml dangling-XMRef tail** — MathFork/split content-arm xml:id
  duplication; the last live `expected:id` class. See
  `EXPECTED_ID_XMREF_DESIGN_2026-06-08.md`.
- **xy-pic `svg:path` / curve cluster** (1501.03690) — shifted-arrows `svg:path`
  in `ltx:text`; mode-frame cascade root.

**SHARED (both engines fail — match Perl; do NOT "fix" by downgrading):**
- **1804.01117 xint raw-load** — both raw-load xint and fail (plain: both stub,
  byte-identical). The Rust stack-overflow crash is FIXED (gullet `stack_guard`,
  configurable via `latexml_core::stack_guard`). Deep xint emulation parked.
- **mode-frame auto-close cluster** (1611.04940, 2009.05630, 1702.06692,
  1702.02037) — a theorem env opened via its bare begin-command with no matching
  `\end…` leaks the mode-switch frame; Perl `Stomach.pm:343-376` errors
  identically. A graceful auto-close would *surpass* Perl (beyond-parity R&D).

## Reference (stable — not active work)

### Engine file open gaps (MINOR, demand-driven)
- `tex_box.rs` box-dimension edges; `tex_fonts.rs` `\fontdimen` array + per-font
  `\hyphenchar`; `tex_tables.rs` padding CSS (XSLT concern).
- **Document-builder block/paragraph auto-wrap of inline content** (core,
  broad/risky family — two witnesses):
  - **`\fcolorbox` inline paragraph-grouping**: an inline `\fcolorbox`
    mid-paragraph — Perl breaks the `<p>` (its `internal_vertical` block ends
    it), Rust keeps it inline. SAME flags on both; Rust's inline reading
    arguably matches real LaTeX's `\mbox`-based `\fcolorbox`. (`\colorbox`
    matches.)
  - **bare `\includegraphics` run in a figure** (witness 1108.0198, found
    2026-06-21 via skeleton diff — a clean, error-free reproducer): a
    `\begin{figure*}` with several consecutive `\includegraphics` (no blank
    line) — Perl wraps the inline run in a `<ltx:block>` (`figure > tags >
    block > graphics×N`), Rust emits the graphics bare (`figure > graphics×N`).
    Rust is error-clean and schema-valid, so this is a COSMETIC structural
    divergence, not a validity bug. Same root: Perl's builder opens a block for
    a horizontal run inside a block-context element; Rust doesn't.
- **`\resizebox` panel scale-VALUE divergence**: in `complex/figure_mixed_content`
  two panels get a different computed natural width (xscale 1.13 vs 0.88). The
  construct in ISOLATION matches exactly (both xscale=1.9685); the divergence
  only appears inside the paper's `\footnotesize` + `table*` + `\subfloat` panel
  context → a font-size/box-context interaction. Scale *formatting* (%.15g) is
  already Perl-faithful (`551c5286ba`); missing-image candidates too
  (`64dd30b284`). Deep box-metric; for the focused box session.
- **~72-CS Perl-only long tail** (from the archived LoadFormat audit): misc
  atomics (`\@charlb`, point-size CSes, `\batchmode`, …) Perl defines, Rust does
  not. Investigate a CS only when a real paper witnesses it; refresh the CS-name
  diff before quoting counts (predates the BibTeX port).

### Primitive layer — AUDITED FAITHFUL (2026-06-20)
Probe-based Rust-vs-Perl audit found the core primitive layer byte-identical
(arithmetic, dimensions, glue, conditionals, string/token, case tables). Don't
re-audit without a witnessing paper. Shared-with-Perl quirks (NOT Rust bugs):
`\numexpr` divideround round-half-toward-+∞ (KNOWN_PERL_ERRORS #33); `\the\skip`
drops stretch/shrink to bare pt.

### Permanent ignores
- **Out-of-scope**: ns1–ns5 (`52_namespace`, no DTD support); 2402.03300,
  2410.10068, 2511.03798 (Perl also fails).
- **Rust supersedes Perl**: `1207.6068`, `0909.3444`, + 40 more in
  `memory/project_rust_supersedes_perl.md`.
- **BibTeX**: `BibTeX.pool.ltxml` ported (Phases 1–8; remaining B1–B6 polish in
  `BIBTEX_PORT_PLAN.md`). `--nobibtex` is opt-out, not default.

### Tikz known diffs vs Perl
`foreignObject` transform; arrow-tip path data; SVG viewBox/width; matrix
`<svg:g class="ltx_tikzmatrix">` vs inline-blocks; **bare `svg:g` in `<ltx:block>`**
(tikz-cd) trips a core-XML validity error but post-processing recovers (witness
2006.12702) — Rust-only, low priority (output recovered).

### Graphics renderer chain (subprocess-only; LANDED)
PDF→PNG `mutool draw`→`pdftocairo`→`convert+gs`; PDF→SVG `mutool convert`→
`pdftocairo`→`inkscape`. Subprocess `exec` (no GPL linking). Apt: `poppler-utils`
(req), `mupdf-tools` (rec), `imagemagick+ghostscript`, `inkscape`.

### Other tracks (separate docs)
- Performance: `PERFORMANCE.md` (P1 math/large-doc open; P2 allocation partial).
- Release gates: `RELEASE_CRITERIA.md`. Releasing: `RELEASING.md`.
- Completed missions (archived): strict-LoadFormat dump parity, Marpa ASF
  migration, distribution-readiness, the 500K/1M warning-corpus mission, and the
  diagnostic-message faithfulness pass (2026-06-20) — see `docs/archive/` and
  `git log`.
