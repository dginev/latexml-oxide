## How to read this file

**Start at "Ranked worklist" below and take the top unblocked row.** That is the
whole intent of this file; everything after it is supporting detail.

| section | what it is | when you read it |
|---|---|---|
| **Ranked worklist** | every open item, ordered, with size + where the detail lives | **first, always** |
| Current status | suite count, the last session, release state | to orient |
| Open items | the detail behind the ranked rows | when you pick that row |
| Standing policies | rules that constrain *how* you fix things | before adding a CLI flag, a stub, or a divergence |
| Parked families | pointers to four extracted docs | only when starting that family |
| Reference | stable facts, not work | when something surprises you |

Three rules that keep this file honest:

1. **Verify a status label before acting on it — and before deleting it.** Four
   entries here have pointed at work that did not exist: a `13 commits NOT
   PUSHED` banner (merged as PR #323), a "#312 → render under MathJax 4" step
   (issue closed; `ISSUE_AUDIT.md` calls that screenshot out of scope), a
   `CLI options (#191) — ACTIVE` heading (issue closed), and a "PR #310 … ready
   to merge" line (already merged). Check the **named guard test** in the tree,
   or `gh issue view <N>` / `gh pr view <N>`. **SHA-ancestry does not work** as a
   check — the repo squash-merges, so a branch SHA quoted here is never an
   ancestor of `main`.
2. **This is the BRIEF ACTIONABLE LIST.** Day-by-day logs live in `git log` and
   `docs/archive/`. When you close an item, delete it here and lift anything
   worth re-reading into `docs/archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_YYYY-MM.md`.
3. **Keep it under ~500 lines.** When a section outgrows ~100 lines it has become
   its own subject — give it a doc under `docs/` and leave a one-line pointer.

*Last compaction: 2026-07-25 — 1979 → ~500 lines. 23 completed sections lifted to
`SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-07.md`; four standing families extracted (see Parked
families).*

## Ranked worklist — start here

Ordered by: **does it reproduce today** → **is a real user affected** → **is it
unblocked** → **effort**. Rows R1–R2 are small and self-contained; R4+ need a
session of their own. Re-verify a row before planning on it (rule 1).

## Current status

- **2026-07-25 — session: siunitx v3 + split-fence math, and a worklist freshening.**
  Merged `0f7711c0b5` (PR #372) — faithful `six_format_complexnumber`
  (imaginary-unit semantics, `complex-root-position`, mantissa brackets; 0→17 of
  Perl's 20 golden signatures), the five undefined siunitx v3 commands,
  `\qtyproduct` off `\SIlist`, and Perl's `\sisetup` defaults mirrored 57→107 keys.
  Merged `0dda6ca833` (PR #373) — fences split by TeX's null delimiter now parse
  (divergence #67); measured over 24 arXiv 2606 papers carrying the pattern,
  `unparsed_math` **177 → 102**, 19 improved, 0 regressed, 0 new errors. Witness
  2606.13010 (arXiv/html_feedback#6624) now converts at 0 errors / 0 warnings /
  0 unparsed math. This file was compacted the same day — see the header.

- `cargo test --tests`: **1684 passing / 91 targets, 0 failed, 0 ignored**
  (2026-07-25, on `main` @ `0dda6ca833`, dev box with ImageMagick + ghostscript +
  poppler installed, `mutool` absent). +6 against the 2026-07-24 count of 1678;
  two of those are this session's `siunitx_v3_test` and `split_fence_test`.
  **Caveat that keeps mattering:** the two vector-SVG tests
  (`test_vector_svg_graphics_path`, `test_vector_svg_pathological_convert_case`)
  do NOT go red on a bare host — `svg_converter_available()`
  (`tests/integration.rs`) returns early and reports **ok** when neither `mutool`
  nor `pdftocairo` is on PATH, and the skip `eprintln!` is swallowed without
  `--nocapture`. So a green local run does not prove that branch ran; CI installs
  poppler/mupdf. (An earlier "one `latexml_post` graphics failure needs a host
  image tool" caveat was carried forward for weeks before being shown not to
  reproduce — no `latexml_post` test can produce it as written.)

- **2026-07-17 — crates.io: all code blockers cleared; tagged `0.7.4-rc4`.**
  `#[derive(LoadModel)]` reads `latexml_core`'s **embedded** RelaxNG table instead of
  resolving `LaTeXML.model` cwd-relative, so `resources/RelaxNG` could move into
  `latexml_core/` (108 files) where `cargo package` sees it. Also B6 (`readme`
  outside the crate dir → symlink) and the dead `script-bindings` alias, dropped
  pre-publish. Detail: [`release/CRATES_IO_PUBLISH.md`](release/CRATES_IO_PUBLISH.md)
  B3b/B6.
  **The class worth remembering: a resource move silently breaks path-referencing
  gates.** `audit_vendored_natives.py` scanned only the root `resources/`, so B3a had
  *already* dropped XSLT/CSS/js out of the license audit unnoticed, and B3b would have
  printed `ok resources/RelaxNG/svg/ (0 file(s))` and exited 0 — its own header's
  scenario. Fixed, plus a prefix-must-exist guard (verified to fire). Same for
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` §2.2/§2.3, `LICENSE_INVENTORY` §B, `compileschema.sh`, the XML
  catalog, and ar5iv-editor's deploy script.
  **Tags are bare-numeric, no `v`** (`release.yml` matches `[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-*`;
  `v0.7.4-rc4` runs nothing), and `make_release.sh` refuses a tag ≠ Cargo.toml version.

- **2026-07-09 — `\AtBeginDocument` #2754/#2846 re-done via context-aware `\par`
  (Direction B retired; ported to Perl too).** The earlier `inBeginDocumentHook`
  guard-decouple is reverted: `\begin{document}` restores the pre-#2846
  `inPreamble=0`-after-hooks placement and `only_preamble` is a plain `inPreamble`
  check again (no second flag). `\lx@normal@par` is a no-op **only in the raw
  preamble** — `inPreamble` set AND `document` NOT on the `current_environment`
  stack; everywhere else it closes the paragraph being built. So a blank line in
  `\AtBeginDocument` (runs in the document env) splits paragraphs (#2754) while a
  deferred `\RequirePackage`/`\usepackage` stays legal (inPreamble still 1). NOT the
  note's literal "no-op in vertical mode": LaTeXML's mode tracking isn't faithful
  (stays vertical after display math — would also mis-merge `\AtBeginDocument{\[x\]…}`;
  raw-preamble text is horizontal yet must merge — expl3 case fixtures), so CONTEXT
  (are we in the document env) is the stable signal; the env-**stack** check also
  handles nested envs inside hooks. Applied identically in Perl
  (`LaTeXML/lib/.../latex_constructs.pool.ltxml` + `TeX_Paragraph.pool.ltxml`,
  `lookupStackedValues`). New regression tests: `tests/structure/atbegindocument_*`.
  See `KNOWN_PERL_ERRORS.md` #43. Candidate to upstream as the #2846 follow-up.

### Session logs (2026-06-22 … 2026-07-08) — ARCHIVED

Completed "Landed this session" entries, the slowest-100 batch triage, the
finished upstream-sync U1–U11 mission log, and the mined-out methodology
history now live in the dated session archives:

- [`archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-07.md`](archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-07.md) —
  the 2026-07-02 … 07-08 window: upstream PR #2829 "Framing", the MathML-post
  exhaustive line audit (waves 1+2), live-run fatal/error mining rounds,
  author/affiliation frontmatter split, width-based figure-panel arrangement,
  and the `\AtBeginDocument`/`\RequirePackage` #2846-port regression fix.
- [`archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-06.md`](archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-06.md) —
  the 2026-06-22 … 07-01 window plus the slowest-100 batch triage and the
  2026-06 cortex-cross-join methodology history.

(Upstream-sync catalog also at
[`archive/UPSTREAM_SYNC_2767_to_2833_2026-06-26.md`](archive/UPSTREAM_SYNC_2767_to_2833_2026-06-26.md).)

## Live residuals from the 2026-07-20 ar5iv sprint (merged as PR #323)

Everything that sprint landed is in `docs/archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-07.md`.
Two scraps are still live:

- **TL2026 dump gate may be closer than recorded** — the expl3 catcode gap is
  closed (2112.11932 1003⇒0, 2110.10227 102⇒0, 2204.05282 86⇒0, 2110.12034 45⇒8;
  2203.05327 411⇒0 via the `aligned_overset_sty.rs` contrib binding, guarded by
  `102_aligned_overset_includestyles.rs`). **Re-run the init gate on a TL2026
  host** before trusting the recorded blocker.
- **ar5iv residuals — closed, do not re-mine.** All three resolve
  parity-or-Rust-better, none Rust-only; detail in `AR5IV_DIAGNOSTICS.md` and
  `docs/archive/SYNC_SESSIONS_2026-07.md`.

## Standing policies & method — read before changing behaviour

### Methodology & the cortex cross-join

Working method (2026-06): **re-triage LARGE-error papers** (the single-error tail
is exhausted) → bisect the doc to the trigger line → verify Perl with `--verbose`
→ fix the divergence. Random sweeps are low-yield.

**Cortex agentic API (reads open, no token):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
Recipe: `GET /api/reports/<corpus>/oxidized-tex-to-html/<severity>` → categories;
`…/<severity>/<category>` → per-`what`; `…/<category>/<what>` → paper list. Then
`GET /api/corpus/<corpus>/tex_to_html/document/<id>` for Perl status — a Rust-only
win is **Perl=no_problem/warning but Rust=error/fatal**. Corpus
`sandbox-arxiv-10k-shuffle`. URL-encode `\`→`%5C`, `^`→`%5E`.

### CLI options — the option-C policy (issue #191 CLOSED 2026-07-09) + `validate()`

Issue #191 "support the original latexmlc/latexmlpost options" is **closed**;
what survives here is the standing **option-C policy** it established, plus the
one feature deliberately left undone (`validate()`, below). The policy: wire only
options whose engine feature genuinely works end-to-end; keep the clap parser
**strict** (no accept-and-warn stubs); deferred/missing features stay hard parse
errors. Consult it before adding any CLI flag.

#### Deferred — feature genuinely NOT supported (do NOT stub)
- `--parse=STRATEGY` — grammar selection unsupported (one Marpa grammar);
  `--nomathparse` / `--mathparse` is the real interface. (Attempted + removed.)
- `--svg` / `--nosvg` — **deferred (verified 2026-07-09):** the HTML5 XSLT
  already renders `<ltx:picture>` as inline `<svg>` by default, so the standalone
  `svg.rs` post-processor (`impl Processor for SVG`, unwired) is redundant and
  produces divergent, unverified output (25 vs 27 `<svg>` on `tests/graphics/
  picture.tex`). Wiring it was built + reverted.
- `--pictureimages` / `--nopictureimages` — `picture_images.rs` delegates to the
  **unwired LaTeXImages latex+dvipng pipeline** (`latex_images.rs`); same
  category/effort as `--mathimages`.
- `--openmath|om` — no OpenMath serializer. (User: defer.)
- daemon net (`--port` / `--address` / `--expire` / `--autoflush` / `--cache_key`)
  — socket-daemon model; we ship `--server` (stdio LSP). (User: defer.)
- `--mode` (= alias for `--profile`); `--profile=NAME` — needs a preset registry.
- `--mathimages` / `--mathsvg` / `--mathimagemagnification` — needs a
  latex+dvipng math-render pipeline.
- `--unicodemath` / `--plane1` / `--hackplane1` / `--linelength` — plain/unicode
  math output modes.
- crossref cluster (`--crossref` / `--scan` / `--noscan` / `--urlstyle` /
  `--prescan` / `--dbfile` / `--bibliography` / `--splitbibliography`) + index
  cluster (`--index` / `--permutedindex` / `--splitindex`) — multi-doc site-DB
  features. (Scan IS wired as post Phase 2, so `--noscan` is a real-but-risky
  off-switch; parked with the cluster.)
- `--tex` / `--box` — intermediate box/tex serializers absent.
- `--omitdoctype` — DTD-only in Perl; Rust has no DTD (moot).

#### `validate()` / `--validate` — POSTPONED to the NEXT release (decided 2026-07-09)
Today `Post::Document::validate()` (`latexml_post/src/document.rs:1717`) is a
STUB: it logs "Would validate against RelaxNG schema" and returns `Ok(())`.
Real RelaxNG validation is wanted, but is **deferred to the next release** because
it is gated on a `rust-libxml` crates.io publish (see below). Reference: Perl
`LaTeXML/lib/LaTeXML/Common/XML/RelaxNG.pm` + `LaTeXML/lib/LaTeXML/Post.pm`.

**Architecture decision (owner, 2026-07-09): `rust-libxml` provides the public,
safe Rust RelaxNG interface; `latexml-oxide` is a pure consumer.** All libxml2
`unsafe`/FFI stays in the fork — the alternative (raw `xmlRelaxNG*` FFI inline in
`latexml_post`, which would compile against the shipped crates.io `libxml 0.3.15`
with no publish) was **rejected**. So this feature cannot fully land until the
fork's RelaxNG module is published as `libxml 0.3.16`.

Constraint: the schema is **modular** (`LaTeXML.rng` `<include>`s
`LaTeXML-common.rng`, `-structure`, `-math`, …) and the binary is
**self-contained** — no on-disk schema. Includes MUST resolve through the
embedded table (`latexml_core::common::relaxng::embedded::lookup`), served via
the fork's existing `libxml::io::register_input_callback` (built for exactly this
— "bundles RNG schemas via include_bytes! … RelaxNG `<include>` via
`xmlRelaxNGParse`"), NOT disk.

Steps (next-release session):
1. **rust-libxml fork — add a safe `relaxng` module.** The fork's `schemas`
   module is **XSD-only** (`xmlSchema*`). Mirror it: `relaxng/{parser,schema,
   validation}.rs` wrapping `xmlRelaxNGNewParserCtxt`(URL — so relative includes
   resolve through the callback) / `xmlRelaxNGNewMemParserCtxt` + `xmlRelaxNGParse`
   (→ `RelaxNGSchema`) and `xmlRelaxNGNewValidCtxt` + `xmlRelaxNGValidateDoc`
   (→ `RelaxNGValidationContext`), with `xmlRelaxNGSetValidStructuredErrors`
   capture. Fork unit test (valid + invalid doc). **Publish `libxml 0.3.16`.**
2. **Embedded-include resolution** via `libxml::io::register_input_callback`
   (`embed:///RelaxNG/LaTeXML-*.rng` → `embedded::lookup`); verify with the
   renamed-`resources/` smoke that no schema is read from disk.
3. **Consume in workspace** — bump the `libxml` dep `0.3.15` → `0.3.16`; `cargo test`.
4. **Flesh out `validate()`** — parse+cache the schema once; run `validate_doc`;
   map each captured `StructuredError` to a `Warn!` / `post_error` in the project
   logging convention (Perl reports schema violations).
5. **Wire `--validate` / `--novalidate`** — CLI flags + `PostOptions.validate`;
   call `validate()` in `run_post_processing_impl` when enabled. DEFAULT
   decision: Perl defaults ON; propose **opt-in** in Rust (validation cost +
   corpus warning noise) as a documented divergence — confirm with owner before
   flipping the default on.
6. **Tests** — a valid fixture validates clean; an intentionally schema-invalid
   doc reports the expected violation; `--novalidate` skips.

### Archived-audit residuals (2026-07-09 docs compaction) — still-open leftovers

Two completed diagnostic snapshots were dated + archived; their still-open
residuals stay here so the live worklist keeps them visible:

- **MathML-post line audit** (sweep complete; →
  `archive/MATHML_POST_LINE_AUDIT_2026-07-05.md`). Open feature-gaps: **F5**
  Linebreaker (full feature gap — the sketch used the wrong strategy), **F11**
  Hint width normalization, **F14** multirelation + lt-or-approx cMML, **F15**
  continued-fraction, **F16** OperatorDictionary Cat A/B data holes + U+2A50
  misclassification + fence U+0331, **F17** formulae pMML arm, plus PARTIAL
  inherited-context bindings on `pmml_top`/`pmml_parenthesize`/`stylizeContent`.
  (Content-MathML items obey the defer-to-a-dedicated-session directive above.)
- **arXiv velocity-fork audit** (items 1–4 landed 2026-07-03; →
  `archive/ARXIV_FORK_AUDIT_2026-07-03.md`). Sole residual: **item G** —
  `readBalanced` drops comment tokens (fork `4e1578d1`); Rust `read_balanced`
  still flushes `pending_comments` (gullet.rs ~L1170). Low urgency
  (`INCLUDE_COMMENTS=false` default); port at the next gullet-seam session.

## Open items — detail for the ranked rows

### R1 — upstream `brucemiller/LaTeXML#2852`: a subfile's `\documentclass` options are not packages

**OPEN upstream** (state checked 2026-07-25); **our half is already merged as PR
#310**, so nothing is pending here in this repo. The allowlist was hand-split on
`,` and missed every valued form (`[varwidth=5cm]` → `Error:undefined:{varwidth}`,
pdflatex clean); it now reads `OptionalKeyVals` and matches on the key. The same
fix is ported to Perl (`OptionalKeyVals` + `getPairs`) with a `t/structure` case
that actually guards it, pushed to `dginev/LaTeXML`. **Action: check its CI, then
ask for review** — no code work expected. *(This entry read "PR #310 … Ready to
merge" until 2026-07-25, long after it merged.)*


### R2 — `--preload=<cls>` alone trips the hook stack; class-name divergence — OPEN (re-verified 2026-07-25)

**Symptom.** `--preload=<any>.cls` prints `LaTeX hooks Error: Extra \PopDefaultHookLabel`
(article/book/report; `.sty` clean; `\documentclass` clean; `LATEXML_NODUMP=1` clean).
Perl is silent for the same preload.

**Mechanism (traced, 2026-07-17).** Push/pop are perfectly balanced and nested — the trace
is `PUSH article → (LaTeX.pool loads) → PUSH textcomp → POP textcomp → POP article → error`.
The bug is that **`\@pushfilename` changes MEANING mid-load**: `article` is pushed *before*
`LaTeX.pool` (and the kernel dump behind it) loads, so it uses a pre-pool `\@pushfilename`
that never touches `\g__hook_name_stack_seq`; the pool then installs the real expl3
`\@popfilename`, so `article`'s pop hits a seq holding only the *inner* packages' pushes,
finds it empty, and errors. `\documentclass` escapes because the pool is already loaded, so
both sites use the same meaning.

**A definedness check cannot see this** — the CS is defined at both sites; only its meaning
changes. Perl's `$pushpop` (Package.pm L2595, computed once and reused at L2637) is a
definedness check too, so Perl has the same hole; it is silent only because its dump omits
`\g__hook_name_stack_seq`, and `\seq_gpop:NNTF` on an *undefined* seq does not complain.
Ours dumps it as `\c_empty_seq`, so the real expl3 code correctly notices.

**Mitigated, not fixed (2026-07-17):** `util::preset::new_test_engine` now preloads
`LaTeX.pool` first (the order ar5iv's list already used), so `latexmlmath_oxide` stops
provoking it. `--preload=article.cls` on its own STILL errors.

**Dead ends — measured, do not retry:**
* Filtering the L3-hook stubs + filename stack from the dump (write+read): symptom gone,
  preloads clean — but `cluster_mhchem_cf_author_macro` 0 → **1003 errors** (suite 1581/0 →
  1572/9). The dump REPLACES base (DUMP_DESIGN rule 1), so filtering leaves a HOLE, not a
  fallback to `latex_base.rs`.
* Filtering ONLY `\g__hook_name_stack_seq` to match Perl's dump exactly: symptom gone,
  mhchem still fails — that record is load-bearing for our expl3 emulation.
* Threading Perl's `$pushpop` from push to pop instead of re-deciding (more Perl-faithful,
  worth doing anyway): does NOT fix it — the flag is `true` at both sites; the *meaning*
  moved underneath.
* Filtering `\PopDefaultHookLabel` alone: inert. The erroring caller is the internal
  `\__hook_curr_name_pop:`.

**Both seams pinned (2026-07-25).** Push: `latexml_core/src/binding/content.rs:992-1005`
(`push_defined && pop_defined` → digest `\@pushfilename{}{}{name}`). Pop:
`content.rs:822-828` (`pop_use_expl` recomputes the same definedness pair and
digests `\@popfilename`). The pop's comment states it re-checks "rather than
threading a flag" — for THIS bug it must thread, because the state legitimately
changed between the two.

**Usable discriminator for fix (b).** "Did *this frame* push onto the hook-name
stack?" is answerable: the expl3 `\@pushfilename` body chains into
`\@expl@push@filename@aux@@` (recorded in the push-site comment at
`content.rs:984`), the pre-pool one does not. So inspect the push-time *body*,
carry that answer to the pop, and select `\@popfilename` vs `\lx@popfilename`
from it instead of from definedness. NOT yet implemented — the remaining design
choice is where to thread it (`InputDefinitionOptions` is the obvious carrier)
and whether (c) "pool before any handleoptions push" is the cleaner cause-fix.
Do not start without re-reading the four dead ends above.

**Candidate fixes.** (a) Ensure a class/package preload cannot be the thing that drags in
the pool — auto-prepend `LaTeX.pool` when any `.sty`/`.cls` is preloaded. Rejected for the
release: Perl prepends only `TeX.pool` (LaTeXML.pm L710) and never auto-loads `LaTeX.pool`,
so this is a Rust-only divergence, and it would drag the LaTeX kernel into a `.sty` preload
on a plain-TeX document (the LaTeX-2.09 class `graphicx_sty.rs` already guards against). If
adopted, make it conditional on the pool being unloaded and LOG it. (b) Pair the pop to the
push's actual *meaning* rather than to definedness. (c) Make the pool load before any
handleoptions push. (b)/(c) address the cause.

**Second divergence, same area.** `\documentclass{article}` → `<?latexml class="article"?>`
but `--preload=article.cls` → `<?latexml class="article.cls"?>`; **Perl emits
`class="article"` for both.** Otherwise the two paths' output is byte-identical, so the
preload does load `article_cls.rs` correctly; `parse_preload_spec` splits correctly to
`("article","cls")`, so the extension is re-attached further in.

### R4 — biblatex `.bbl` TokenLimit loop, 2605.17646 (pre-existing, NOT a PR regression)

A biblatex (apa style) paper whose `.bbl` ends in `\missing{Cowen2021}` hits
`Fatal:Timeout:TokenLimit` (999M tokens) during .bbl processing under the
ar5iv profile. Bisect 2026-07-04: **9a679469e1 (run-230 binary) fatals
identically** under equal local conditions (release, `LATEXML_TOKEN_LIMIT`
=50M, `--preload=ar5iv.sty`) — run 230's "error" status for this paper was
fleet nondeterminism, so the July PR branch did not introduce it. Repro:
`scratchpad fatal5/17646src` (arXiv 2605.17646). Suspect area: biblatex
runtime binding's refsection/datalist handling with `\missing`. Not a
July-5 blocker; needs a dedicated session.


### R6 — `ltx_env_<name>` env-markup class — PLANNED, needs its own branch (churns every test XML)
**User-requested generic enhancement** (2026-06-27): tag environment wrapper markup
with `class="ltx_env_<name>"` so custom/minipage-like envs (e.g. `SideBySideExample`)
become responsively styleable in CSS instead of fixed-width minipages. **MUST be on a
dedicated branch** — it changes nearly every test XML (additive class on every env
element), so the golden-suite update is large and must be done in isolation.
Two implementations, same markup outcome:
- **Binding side (`DefEnvironment!`):** the constructor guarantees exactly one element,
  so unconditionally add `ltx_env_<name>` (via an `@ADDCLASS`/`add_class` after the
  begin constructor opens). Applies to ALL DefEnvironments (`figure`, `table`,
  `theorem`, `minipage`, …) — user chose full scope.
- **Raw side (`\newenvironment`/`\renewenvironment`):** arm at env start; at `\begin`
  construction record `{name, anchor = globally-unique gid of current node, mark}`; at
  `\end` afterConstruct, if EXACTLY ONE element was deposited under the anchor since
  the mark → tag it; zero (font/text-only) or >1 (siblings, e.g. SideBySideExample's
  parboxes) → nothing. **Needs a globally-unique monotonic node gid** (verify/ add;
  `record_node_ids` exists but is xml:id-oriented).
- **SideBySideExample:** keep the working `fancyvrb-ex` raw-load (correct source+result)
  + drive responsive layout from the resulting `ltx_minipage`/`ltx_env_*` hooks in
  `ar5iv.css`; do NOT re-implement the verbatim+render dual capture.

### (not ranked) `\gls`/`\acrshort` in MATH mode, 1705.10306 — PARITY, blocked on unrunnable Perl — do not chase
293 errors `ltx:XMTok isn't allowed in <ltx:glossaryref>`: a glossary command in
math mode digests the link display text (#3, the literal acronym term) as math →
bare per-letter `<XMTok>`, which the `glossaryref` content model rejects.
**Source-confirmed 2026-06-27 that this is most likely PARITY (NOT a Rust-only
gap — the cortex "Perl 1" is stale/unreliable, per `use-cortex-for-parity-work`):**
- Perl `Stomach.pm::enterHorizontal` (L422-434) is a **no-op in math** (`$mode
  =~ /math$/ => {}`) — Rust's `enter_horizontal` matches faithfully. So the
  `enterHorizontal => 1` on the shared `\lx@glossaries@gls@link` constructor does
  NOT switch #3 to text in math in EITHER engine.
- BOTH engines raw-load the SAME `glossaries.sty` (`InputDefinitions(noltxml=>1)`)
  with the SAME override constructor → both digest #3 in the ambient math mode →
  both produce `glossaryref > XMTok` → both hit the same schema rejection.
- `\ref`/`\cite` in math do NOT error (verified) — their content is STRUCTURED
  (bibref / ref-number), not a literal term; only `\gls`/`\acrshort` emit raw
  letter-XMToks. So glossaryref is specific, but the mechanism is shared with Perl.
- **The earlier "Perl raw-loads glossaries.sty and typesets as TEXT" hypothesis is
  weakened:** Rust raw-loads the identical `.sty`, so if it typeset the term as
  text, Rust would too. It doesn't (output: italic letter-XMToks) → so the `.sty`
  display chain does NOT force text in math.
**Perl confirmed UNRUNNABLE here (2026-06-27):** `latexml glx.tex` → `Fatal:terminate`
in `expl3-code.tex` (l3kernel) at 150 s — glossaries pulls in expl3 which is
pathologically slow in Perl 0.8.8 on this host; cannot capture ground truth.
**Fixing is therefore deferred as a likely non-bug.** If pursued, it parallels the
figure_mixed_content surpass-Perl pattern (a monotonic schema expansion to accept
the math content the builder already produces) — BUT the correct structure is
genuinely uncertain without Perl (XMTok directly? XMText-wrapped? operator-token
for the `\DeclareMathOperator` case? text PCDATA?), and there is **no precedent**
for `XMTok` in any inline element's model, so a speculative change risks an
unfaithful divergence. Repro + full notes:
`docs/reproducers/glossaryref_math_xmtok.tex`.

## Reference (stable — not active work)

### Engine file open gaps (MINOR, demand-driven)
- `tex_box.rs` box-dimension edges; `tex_fonts.rs` `\fontdimen` array + per-font
  `\hyphenchar`; `tex_tables.rs` padding CSS (XSLT concern).
- **Document-builder block/paragraph auto-wrap of inline content** (core,
  broad/risky family — two witnesses):
  - **`\fcolorbox` inline paragraph-grouping**: an inline `\fcolorbox`
    mid-paragraph — Perl breaks the `<p>` (its `internal_vertical` block ends
    it), Rust keeps it inline. SAME flags on both; Rust's inline reading
    arguably matches real LaTeX's `\mbox`-based `\fcolorbox`. (`\colorbox`
    matches.)
  - **bare `\includegraphics` run in a figure** (witness 1108.0198, found
    2026-06-21 via skeleton diff — a clean, error-free reproducer): a
    `\begin{figure*}` with several consecutive `\includegraphics` (no blank
    line) — Perl wraps the inline run in a `<ltx:block>` (`figure > tags >
    block > graphics×N`), Rust emits the graphics bare (`figure > graphics×N`).
    Rust is error-clean and schema-valid. **Re-witnessed + root-confirmed
    2026-06-27** (0704.0001, 0704.0017 via the corrected structural diff): NOT
    merely cosmetic — the panel `<graphics>` WIDTHS also diverge (Rust 303.5pt vs
    Perl 241.5pt, ~1.257×), so figure sizing is visibly affected. Root: Perl's
    `arrange_panels_and_breaks` (`latex_constructs.pool.ltxml:3229-3295`) does a
    full box-metric panel layout — it inserts `<break class="ltx_break">` and wraps
    panels using `getNodeBox($child)->getWidth` vs `float_width`; Rust's
    counterpart (`latex_constructs.rs:1784-1869`) is explicitly **"Simplified: mark
    panel children with the class"** and skips the break/block arrangement. A
    faithful port DEPENDS on matching box widths → the deep box session (sibling of
    the `\resizebox` panel-width item below), not a loop-tick fix.
- **`\resizebox` panel scale-VALUE divergence**: in `complex/figure_mixed_content`
  two panels get a different computed natural width (xscale 1.13 vs 0.88). The
  construct in ISOLATION matches exactly (both xscale=1.9685); the divergence
  only appears inside the paper's `\footnotesize` + `table*` + `\subfloat` panel
  context → a font-size/box-context interaction. Scale *formatting* (%.15g) is
  already Perl-faithful (`551c5286ba`); missing-image candidates too
  (`64dd30b284`). Deep box-metric; for the focused box session.
- **~72-CS Perl-only long tail** (from the archived LoadFormat audit): misc
  atomics (`\@charlb`, point-size CSes, `\batchmode`, …) Perl defines, Rust does
  not. Investigate a CS only when a real paper witnesses it; refresh the CS-name
  diff before quoting counts (predates the BibTeX port).

### Primitive layer — AUDITED FAITHFUL (2026-06-20)
Probe-based Rust-vs-Perl audit found the core primitive layer byte-identical
(arithmetic, dimensions, glue, conditionals, string/token, case tables). Don't
re-audit without a witnessing paper. Shared-with-Perl quirks (NOT Rust bugs):
`\numexpr` divideround round-half-toward-+∞ (KNOWN_PERL_ERRORS #33); `\the\skip`
drops stretch/shrink to bare pt.

### Permanent ignores
- **Out-of-scope**: ns1–ns5 (`52_namespace`, no DTD support); 2402.03300,
  2410.10068, 2511.03798 (Perl also fails).
- **Rust supersedes Perl**: `1207.6068`, `0909.3444`, + 40 more in
  `memory/project_rust_supersedes_perl.md`.
- **BibTeX**: `BibTeX.pool.ltxml` ported (Phases 1–8; remaining B1–B6 polish in
  `BIBTEX_PORT_PLAN.md`). `--nobibtex` is opt-out, not default.

### Tikz known diffs vs Perl
`foreignObject` transform; arrow-tip path data; SVG viewBox/width; matrix
`<svg:g class="ltx_tikzmatrix">` vs inline-blocks; **bare `svg:g` in `<ltx:block>`**
(tikz-cd) trips a core-XML validity error but post-processing recovers (witness
2006.12702) — Rust-only, low priority (output recovered).

### Graphics renderer chain (subprocess-only; LANDED)
PDF→PNG `mutool draw`→`pdftocairo`→`convert+gs`; PDF→SVG `mutool convert`→
`pdftocairo`→(raster PNG fallback). EPS/PS→`gs` direct→`convert+gs`. Subprocess
`exec` (no GPL linking). Apt: `poppler-utils` (req), `mupdf-tools` (rec),
`imagemagick+ghostscript`. A heavyweight inkscape third resort for PDF→SVG was
removed 2026-06-29 (GTK stack, 20–40× slower, timeout-prone, no coverage over the
raster fallback).

### Other tracks (separate docs)
- Performance: `PERFORMANCE.md` (P1 math/large-doc open; P2 allocation partial).
- Release gates: `RELEASE_CRITERIA.md`. Releasing: `RELEASING.md`.

  [`archive/BIBTEX_PORT_PLAN_2026-06-20.md`](archive/BIBTEX_PORT_PLAN_2026-06-20.md)):**
  Phases 1–8 shipped; live residuals = the Phase 4–5 field-handler/MR-Zbl
  long tail, divergences B1–B6 noted in `bibtex.rs`, and the deferred
  **native `.bst` interpretation** (witness 2605.16562, `f65cf7d6dc`) —
  demand-driven, pick up on corpus evidence.
