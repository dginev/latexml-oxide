## Math-parser / content-MathML gaps — DEFERRED to a dedicated session

> **User directive 2026-06-20: defer ALL content-MathML items to a dedicated
> session** (the math parser is a full Marpa-vs-RecDescent rewrite; these touch
> the parse-tree / content-MathML structure and want a focused regression
> budget). Notes kept here; do NOT pick at them piecemeal.

- **`f(a,b)` multi-arg flattening — FIXED 2026-06-22.** A KNOWN function applied
  to a paren comma-list now flattens: `\max(a,b)`→`maximum@(a,b)` (was
  `maximum@(vector@(a,b))`), matching Perl `ApplyDelimited`/`extract_separators`.
  Implementation was simpler than the planned grammar-rule approach: a post-parse
  spread in the `prefix_apply` ACTION (`semantics.rs`, helper `vector_tuple_items`)
  — when a function-role op (FUNCTION/OPFUNCTION/TRIGFUNCTION) applies to a
  `Dual` whose content is `Apply(vector, [refs])`, spread the items as direct
  operands instead of wrapping. No grammar/pruning change → NOT pruning-sensitive,
  zero fixture regressions. Scoped to known function roles, so unknown-`f` apply
  (`f(a,b)`→`f@(vector@(a,b))`) is untouched — the intentional divergence #18.
  Verified Perl-identical: `\max(a,b)`/`\gcd(a,b)`/`\min(x,y,z)`/`g(a,b,c)` +
  nesting/`\frac`/trailing-ops; suite 1466/0; regression test in
  `parse/functions`. (Known pre-existing aside: juxtaposed `\max(a,b)\min(c,d)`
  greedily reads `\max` over the product — a separate function-juxtaposition
  pruning issue, not this flatten.)
- **`f(x)` single-arg apply-vs-multiply** (most PERVASIVE divergence): for an
  UNKNOWN/undeclared symbol + paren arg, Rust reads *application*, Perl reads
  *multiplication* — `\Gamma(s)`→Rust `Gamma@(s)` vs Perl `Gamma * s` (likewise
  `\zeta(s)`, `\Phi(x)`, `f(x)`). A real fix must respect Perl's "only declared
  FUNCTION/known-operator names apply; bare letters multiply" rule; heavily
  pruning-sensitive.
  > **SURVEY 2026-06-22 (current-state + blast radius — groundwork, NOT yet
  > changed):** confirmed the split cleanly — KNOWN functions ALREADY match Perl
  > (`\sin(x)`/`\log(x)` → `sine@(x)`/`logarithm@(x)` in both); only UNKNOWN
  > symbols diverge (`f(x)`/`g(x)`/`P(x)`/`\Gamma(s)`/`\zeta(s)`/`\phi(x)` →
  > Rust `X@(x)` vs Perl `X * x`; `f(x+1)` → Rust `f@(x+1)` vs Perl `f * (x+1)`).
  > LEXER ROLE: unknown `f` = `role="UNKNOWN"`, `\max` = `role="OPFUNCTION"` — so
  > the apply-of-UNKNOWN (A) is separable from the known-fn flatten (B). BLAST
  > RADIUS of A is corpus-wide: 25 test fixtures, ~150 single-letter applies
  > (`f@(`×57, `d@(`×51, `g@(`×13, …) would flip to multiply — a sweeping change
  > that reshapes all math output. Because A is corpus-wide (even though
  > toward-Perl), it needed explicit scope sign-off; B (below) was the
  > contained first step (~5 fixtures).
  > **DECISION FINAL 2026-07-02: divergence #18 STANDS — `f(x)` leans toward
  > function application.** The toward-Perl flip was green-lit earlier the
  > same day, fully implemented (12/12 witness parity with Perl, ~22 fixtures
  > verified toward-Perl), and then **REVERTED on user review**: "f(x) is
  > almost always an application in common STEM use." The apply-of-UNKNOWN
  > reading is the settled intentional divergence (OXIDIZED_DESIGN #18,
  > re-affirmed). The reverted implementation is preserved on branch
  > `archive/fx-perl-parity-attempt-2026-07-02` (local) for reference — do
  > NOT re-attempt the flip without a fresh explicit user decision.
- **`[a|b]` / `[a \mid b]` bracket-conditional — FIXED 2026-06-22.** Was unparsed
  in Rust; now `delimited-[]@(conditional@(a,b))` matching Perl (`E[X|Y]` etc.).
  Root: the bare `a|b` conditional reduces only at statement level (not as an
  `expression`), so `[a|b]` had no fence rule — though `[(a|b)]` already worked.
  Fix: a surgical grammar rule `lbracket formula singlevertbar formula rbracket =>
  bracket_conditional` (`singlevertbar` also covers `\mid`) + a `bracket_conditional`
  action (semantics.rs) that builds the inner `conditional@(a,b)` (delimiter-less
  presentation) and wraps it in `delimited-[]` via the same `fenced` path
  `[(a|b)]` uses (ctxt reborrow for the two ref levels). Suite 1466/0, clippy
  clean, zero other-fixture changes; regression test in `parse/vertbars`. (The
  `E` in `E[X|Y]` stays `E@(…)` apply vs Perl `E * …` — divergence #18, preserved.)
- **`⁡` DecorateOperator over-insertion — FIXED 2026-06-22.** Presentation MathML
  emitted `⁡` (U+2061 FUNCTION APPLICATION) after operators that render as
  `<m:mo>` — `\nabla \phi`→`∇⁡ϕ`, `\partial f`→`∂⁡f`, and (pre-existing) `\sum_i
  a_i`→`∑⁡a_i`, `\int f`→`∫⁡f` — where Perl juxtaposes (∇ϕ/∂f/∑a/∫f). Perl's rule
  (MathML.pm `Apply:?:?`): insert `⁡` only when the op base is NOT an `<m:mo>` (a
  function identifier `f`/`\sin`/`\max` IS `<m:mi>` → keeps `⁡`). FIX
  (`latexml_post/.../presentation.rs`): new `op_base_is_mo` helper (descends
  msub/msup/munder/mover to the base); applied at the generic-apply site AND in
  `pmml_summation`; and removed `DIFFOP` from the big-op→`pmml_summation` route
  (Perl MathML.pm:702 `# Not DIFFOP`). Suite 1466/0, clippy clean; verified
  Perl-identical for ∇/∂/∑/∫/∏/⋃/lim + `\sin`/`\max`/scripted forms; only residual
  diff is the `f(x)` apply-vs-multiply (`f⁡(` vs `f⁢(`) — divergence #18,
  preserved. Regression test in `tests/post/opdecoration`.
- **wide-space PUNCT XMDual content-arm XMRef ordering**: `x^2\quad y` — the
  `\quad` (≥10pt) becomes a virtual PUNCT through `formulae_apply`, producing an
  XMDual whose content-arm XMRef siblings emit one slot off from Perl. Same
  MathFork/split content-arm xml:id family as the `expected:id` tail
  (`EXPECTED_ID_XMREF_DESIGN_2026-06-08.md`). NOT the rpadding path (thin spaces
  `\,` are Perl-faithful incl. NewScript transfer, `005716ff66`).
- **`\DeclareMathOperator` cluster — INVESTIGATED 2026-06-22, LOW-VALUE metadata,
  deprioritized** (`text=` and cMML already match): (a) Perl splits Math attrs
  `tex="\operatorname{Tr}…"` vs `content-tex="\Tr…"` (Perl defines `\Tr` *via*
  `Invocation(\operatorname,…)` + `revert_as=>'context'`); Rust defines it
  directly so `tex` keeps the user macro `\Tr` (arguably MORE source-faithful) and
  emits no `content-tex`. Matching Perl needs the deep `revert_as=>context`
  content-tex mechanism — high effort, metadata-only value. (b) The `name="Tr"`
  "gap" is NOT a bug: `def_math` (dialect.rs:1567) DOES infer `name` from the CS
  but DROPS it when `name == presentation` (line ~33) — a deliberate
  redundant-attr cleanup. `\Tr` (name "Tr" == content "Tr") drops it; `\argmax`
  (name ≠ "arg max") keeps it. Perl always emits it. Changing this touches the
  GENERAL def_math path (every math token) for cosmetic value → not worth it.
  (c) `\DeclareMathOperator*` `scriptpos` in display mode — the remaining
  candidate if revisited, but mode-dependent and niche. Whole cluster parked.
- **N-ary bare-operator listing — ✅ NOW WORKS (verified 2026-06-27); note was
  STALE.** `+,-,\times,\div` → `list@(+,-,*,/)` (Perl-exact); `+,-`, `+,+`, `a,+,b`,
  `++`, `+-` all parse and match Perl. An intervening fix (likely the comma-list /
  marpa-drain work) closed this. NOT an open gap anymore. The truly-remaining
  operator-script cases are narrower and finicky/context-dependent: `\Omega_{+,+-}`
  (a comma-list-of-operators in a SUBSCRIPT — Perl's subscript grammar parses it as
  `list@(+, absent + -)`, Rust's doesn't; note `+,+-` STANDALONE is PARITY-unparsed
  in BOTH), and operator-scripts where both parse but DIVERGE structurally
  (`a^{++}`: Rust `a^(list@(+,+))` vs Perl `a^(absent + +)`). These are the deferred
  math-fork session (subscript-content grammar + scripted-operator structure).
- **comma-list LEFT of a relation `a,b \in A` — FIXED 2026-06-22 (2-item path).**
  Was the wrong `formulae@(a, b∈A)` (∈ binding only `b`). Now the user-specified
  surpass-Perl **XMDual**: content **DISTRIBUTES** — `formulae@(∈(a,A), ∈(b,A))`,
  sharing XMRefs to the relop and RHS — presentation wraps the list as the
  relation's LHS — `Apply(∈, XMWrap(a,',',b), A)`. Implemented as a scoped
  transform at the end of `formulae_apply` (semantics.rs): when `left` is a bare
  (non-relational, non-Dual) item and `right` is a binary RELOP relation
  `Apply(R,[lhs,rhs])` under a comma, `distribute_list_relation` builds the dual.
  `x,y \le z`→`formulae@(x≤z, y≤z)`. The list-RIGHT `0<x,y`→`list@(0<x,y)`,
  all-relational `a=b,c=d`→`formulae@`, and bare `a,b`→`list@` all stay. Full suite
  1466/0, clippy clean, zero other-fixture changes; regression test in
  `parse/relations`. **Remaining (follow-up):** the 3+-item `a,b,c \in S` goes
  through `list_apply` (not `formulae_apply`) → still `list@(a,b,c∈S)`; the same
  distribution needs porting to that path.
- **relation with a list-RHS that itself contains a scripted relop**:
  `a \le b \quad \stackrel{?}{\ge} \quad c` → Perl `a <= list@(b, >=^?, c)`.
  **UPDATED 2026-06-27: no longer `ltx_math_unparsed` (stale)** — Rust now PARSES
  it as `fragments@(a <= b, >= ^ ?, c)` (the `\quad`-WIDE_PUNCT routes it through
  `formulae_apply`→`fragments@` rather than the relation-with-list-RHS shape). So
  it's now a STRUCTURAL divergence (fragments@ vs `a <= list@(…)`), not a parse
  failure. Lower-severity (renders) cMML-structure item; the scripted-relop atomic
  fix (`4a5ebf29f7`) cleared standalone list items.
- **`\underset`/`\overset` over an ARROW with a multi-token script**:
  `x \underset{n\to\infty}{\to} y` — the under-script reads `n@to@infinity`
  (apply) where Perl groups `(n to infinity)`. Same ARROW-as-applied-function
  family as `f(a,b)`.

- **Thousands-separator comma read as a list separator — OPEN, shared with Perl.
  Policy SETTLED 2026-07-25, implementation seam identified, NOT yet built.**
  `$>50,000$` is ONE number, `50000`, written with a thousands separator.
  Neither engine sees that: Perl builds `>(absent, list(50,000))`, Rust
  `list@(absent>50, 000)` (the #37 reading). The glyphs come out right, so it is
  invisible in a rendered page, but the presentation grouping is wrong too —
  `mrow(mrow(mphantom, >, mn 50), mo ",", mn 000)` where it should be
  `mrow(mo >, mn "50,000")` — and the content arm is nonsense.

  **Owner policy (2026-07-25): default to the US reading (comma = thousands
  separator); support the European reading (comma = decimal separator) as a
  documented secondary, since real corpora contain both.** The locale seam
  already exists and is already right: `base_xmath.rs`'s `DECIMAL_SEP` /
  `THOUSANDS_SEP` maps are keyed by `xml:lang` (`en` → `.`/`,`;
  `de`/`fr`/`nl`/`pt`/`es` → `,`/`.`), and the EU case already works — a `de`
  document's comma is matched by the ligature's *decimal* arm, which has no role
  guard. Only the US case is broken: Perl's thousands arm demands
  `$r ne 'PUNCT'` ("Be paranoid about lists", `Base_XMath.pool.ltxml` L506-508),
  and a math-mode comma is ALWAYS `role="PUNCT"`, so for `en` that arm is dead
  code.

  **Do NOT implement it in the ligature — measured dead end (2026-07-25).**
  Ligatures run from `Document::open_math_text_internal`, i.e. once per token as
  it is appended during building, so `get_next_sibling()` is `None` for every
  node and there is **no right context at all** (verified by tracing: every
  invocation reports `next=None`). A "merge when the group is exactly three
  digits" rule therefore fires the moment the third digit arrives and cannot see
  a fourth coming. Implemented and reverted: it corrupted plausible pairs —
  `$(1, 2024)$` → one number `12024`, `$(12, 3456)$` → `123456` — because the
  premature merge is then extended by the ordinary adjacent-NUMBER rule. Adding
  a start-of-run guard does not help (there is no right sibling to test).

  **Correct home: a `DefRewrite` in the post-build `Rewriting` phase**, which
  runs with the full DOM and BEFORE math parsing (`core_interface.rs`
  Building → Rewriting → Math Parsing). By then the ligature has already
  collapsed each digit run, so the pattern is exactly three siblings —
  `XMTok[@role='NUMBER']`, `XMTok[@role='PUNCT']` with text `,`,
  `XMTok[@role='NUMBER']` — and the group length is simply
  `string-length()` of the third, testable *with* its right context. Merge into
  the first node (text `50,000`, `meaning` `50000`) and unlink the other two,
  unrecording their ids first (the `\not` rewrite in `math_common.rs` L599 is the
  pattern to copy — see its UAF comment). Open sub-questions: whether the rewrite
  engine iterates to a fixpoint (needed for `1,234,567`), and whether to gate on
  `xml:lang` here or keep reading the existing separator maps.
  Witness: arXiv 2605.17646 (`population $ > 50,000$`).

CAUTION: new VERTBAR/fence grammar rules can collide with package-built
structures — always cross-check the affected fixture against Perl before
assuming a regression (the norm rule "regressed" physics_test, but Perl matched
the new output, so it was a parity *fix*).
