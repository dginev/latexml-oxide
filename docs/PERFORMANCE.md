# Performance Optimization Principles

Repeatable checklist. Review before release milestones, after major
features, and during periodic optimisation passes.

---

## 1. Avoid string allocation on hot paths

Never use `.to_string()`, `String::from()`, or `format!()` when a string
is already in the interner arena.

- **String literals**: use `pin!("…")` — per-call-site
  `thread_local! OnceCell<SymStr>`, so subsequent calls are a branch +
  load. Saves the 30–50 ns intern-table probe.
- **Runtime strings**: use `arena::pin(s)`.
- **Comparisons and reads**: use `arena::with*` to access an existing
  `SymStr` without re-allocating.

```rust
// BAD
if token.text.to_string() == "endgroup" { … }
// GOOD
if token.text == pin!("endgroup") { … }
// ALSO GOOD
arena::with(token.text, |s| s == "endgroup")
```

## 2. Minimise `.clone()` — borrow or reorder instead

Borrow the value if you can. If lifetimes get in the way, reorder the
code so the borrow is short. Cloning a `Tokens` or `Vec<Token>` is
~40-80 ns of pointer-bumping per element.

```rust
// BAD: clone for inspection then use
let cloned = tokens.clone();
if cloned.first().is_some_and(|t| t.cc == CC_CS) { do_thing(tokens); }
// GOOD: borrow for inspection
if tokens.first().is_some_and(|t| t.cc == CC_CS) { do_thing(tokens); }
```

## 3. Run clippy and study lint neighborhoods

`cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::perf -W clippy::redundant_clone`
catches the easy wins. When clippy fires on one site, scan adjacent code
— the same author usually wrote both.

## 4. Minimise math-parser ambiguity

The Marpa grammar produces all valid derivations. For ambiguous math
the parse-tree count is combinatorial; each surviving parse consumes
memory and CPU. Reducing parses from 50 to 3 is a 10–20× speedup on
math-heavy documents.

Three tools, in order of preference:

1. **Grammar rules** — kill ambiguity at recognition time.
2. **Semantic actions returning `Err`** — prune during tree
   construction. Reject nonsensical constructions
   (`f(x)(y)` as double-application when `f` isn't higher-order,
   mismatched fence pairs, empty operator sequences).
3. **`Pragma` rules** — select best parse from surviving candidates.
   Less useful for raw performance (all parses must complete first) but
   valuable for representation quality.

## 5. External-process discipline (fork-exec is not free)

Every `gs`/`convert`/`inkscape`/`kpsewhich`/`pdfcrop` costs 10–50 ms
ambient plus dynamic-linker and font-cache init for `gs`/`convert`.
**Coalesce, dedup, and cache before spawning — not after.**

Telemetry across 190k arxiv documents shows the `graphics` phase at
**36.5% of total wall** — the single largest band. Even a modest hit
rate on a content-keyed cache (~30%) translates to ~10% off corpus
wall.

**Landed**: in-doc coalescing (`48fd96ac75`, 2026-05-12) +
persistent on-disk cache (2026-05-16) — see "Graphics phase —
completed work" below. Cache-key contract: include source-bytes
hash + page + DPI + format + render-affecting flags; exclude
timestamps/tmpdir paths; bump a `cache_namespace` constant when
fixing a rendering bug rather than relying on hash invalidation.

**Resolver footgun**: extensionless graphics lookup is also an
external-process risk. If `image_candidates` falls through to kpathsea
for `<path>.png` / `<path>.pdf`, memoize both hits and misses by
`(SOURCEDIRECTORY, path)`. On subprocess-backed kpathsea
(`kpsewhich`), repeated missing figures can otherwise pay a fresh
10–50 ms fork-exec for every `\includegraphics` reference.

---

## Phase distribution (190k aggregate, 2026-05-02..03)

10 stages × 10k arxiv documents (189,991 jobs) from
`telemetry.jsonl.gz`. Sum-of-phases / wall = **97.78%** (above the
92% gate in `TELEMETRY.md`).

| Phase | %wall | mean / job |
|---|---:|---:|
| **graphics** | **36.5%** | 1,047 ms |
| **digest** | **20.3%** | 582 ms |
| **math_parse** | **17.0%** | 488 ms |
| **build** | **11.5%** | 331 ms |
| xslt | 7.2% | 207 ms |
| mathml_pres | 1.8% | 51 ms |
| serialize / post_xml_parse / rewrite | <1% each | |
| crossref / post_scan / mathml_cont / bibliography | <0.5% each | |

Top four bands account for **85% of wall**. Everything else combined
is ~12%.

39.16 M formulae total (mean 206/job). 39.06 M parse attempts produced
45.84 M surviving parses — a **17% over-parse rate** (lever for
Principle 4). Max RSS: 1,692 MB.

## Active improvement plan

### 2026-06-21 benchmark — slowest *healthy* witnesses (NEW, open)

Source: cortex runtimes for `oxidized-tex-to-html`
(`GET /api/services/oxidized-tex-to-html/runtimes`, corpora at
`corpora.latexml.rs/runtimes/oxidized-tex-to-html`; query the LOCAL instance
`127.0.0.1:8000` — the public URL is Anubis-gated). `max_ms` 180001 = the 180 s
watchdog **timeout** (infinite-loop class — out of scope here; track in
`STABILITY_WITNESSES.md`, not as a speed lever). We want papers that **complete**
(status `no_problem`/`warning`) yet run very long — genuine optimisation targets.

**Top 10 healthy long-runners** (sub-178 s, status terminal-clean):

| Wall | Status | Corpus | Paper | Note |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 160.7s | no_problem | 10k-shuffle | `math0605199` | **PiCTeX** plotting (`\beginpicture`/`\axis`/`\setplotarea`); 20 KB/1281 lines — small input, huge time |
| 158.2s | warning | 10k-shuffle | `1201.5525` | large (3.8 MB, 39 files, 17k lines) |
| 115.2s | warning | xy | `1106.6259` | xy-pic graphics cluster |
| 108.5s | no_problem | xy | `math0404373` | xy-pic graphics cluster |
| 108.3s | warning | tikz-cd | `1703.04679` | tikz-cd/pgf graphics cluster |
| 103.3s | warning | 10k-shuffle | `1707.01155` | large (2.9 MB) |
| 99.4s | warning | tikz-cd | `2012.14662` | tikz-cd/pgf graphics cluster |
| 97.9s | warning | tikz-cd | `1307.3836` | tikz-cd/pgf graphics cluster |
| 96.7s | warning | 10k-shuffle | `1510.03361` | 68 KB/4807 lines — small-ish input, high time |
| 91.8s | no_problem | 10k-shuffle | `1803.07098` | large (2.0 MB) |

Two clusters: **graphics** (`xy` + `tikz-cd`, 5/10 — commutative-diagram / pgf
rendering, the known deep hot area; relates to the P1 graphics work) and
**general arXiv** (10k-shuffle, 5/10). Highest-value leads are the
**small-input-huge-time** outliers — `math0605199` (20 KB → 160 s) and
`1510.03361` (68 KB → 97 s): a tiny source consuming minutes signals an
**algorithmic hotspot** (super-linear digest/macro-expansion), likely shared
across many papers. `math0605199` is PiCTeX (notoriously macro-expansion-heavy);
suspect the digest phase.

**MUST-profile-with-the-ar5iv-profile caveat (reconciled 2026-06-21).** The
production runtimes come from `cortex_worker`, which **preloads `ar5iv.sty`** —
this materially changes emulation decisions (and defines packages like PiCTeX).
A bare `latexml_oxide <main>.tex` does NOT match it and gives a **false-fast**
reading: `math0605199` via bare CLI bailed in 0.24 s with 96 errors (PiCTeX
undefined, 3 KB output) vs the production 160 s clean conversion. So profile only
via the production-equivalent recipe (the "Standing performance corpus" block
below: `--preload=ar5iv.sty --path=$HOME/git/ar5iv-bindings/bindings`, or
`cortex_worker --standalone <zip>` with that profile). (`perf` is locked down on this host, so `LATEXML_TELEMETRY_OUT` phase wall times
+ env-gated `Instant` probes are the profiling path.)

**Per-phase attribution of the two small-input hotspots (2026-06-21, ar5iv
profile, `latexml_oxide --preload=ar5iv.sty --path=~/git/ar5iv-bindings/bindings`,
release; both convert with 0 errors):**

- **`math0605199` → `build` phase = 97.3 %** (43.7 s of 44.9 s wall; digest 0.9 %,
  math_parse 1.1 %, graphics 0 assets; 920 formulae, 529 MB RSS). This is a
  **document-builder hotspot**, NOT digest/math/graphics: PiCTeX (`\beginpicture`/
  `\axis`/`\setplotarea`) emits ~920 picture formulae and a large node count, and
  XML `build` (node construction / insertion-point walk) goes super-linear
  (~49 ms/formula in build — orders above normal). **This is the "new evidence"
  the CLOSED "P1 digest + build" lane requires to reopen** — a paper whose profile
  diverges from the digest-bound pattern. Suspect a quadratic in the builder's
  sibling-append / `find_insertion_point` path under high node fan-out; profile
  `latexml_core::document` build hot path with env-gated probes.
  **Concrete low-risk lead (read-only, 2026-06-21):** 7
  `get_child_nodes().is_empty()` sites materialize the *entire* child Vec (O(n),
  walks all siblings) purely to test emptiness, where `get_first_child().is_some()`
  is O(1) — `latexml_core/src/document.rs:432` & `:4718`,
  `latexml_engine/src/base_utilities.rs:1108`, `tex_kern.rs:33`,
  `latex_constructs.rs:1080`/`1083`/`1086`. Behavior-identical swap; on a node
  accumulating N children a per-node emptiness check is O(N²).
  **LANDED 2026-06-21** (all 7 sites → `get_first_child().is_some()/is_none()`;
  `get_child_nodes()` is literally built from `get_first_child()` + sibling walk
  so emptiness is identical; suite 1466/0/0). Measured on `math0605199`:
  build 43.7 s → ~37–40 s, wall 44.9 s → 37–40.6 s (≈10–18 %, single-run
  variance). A real but partial win — **the dominant build quadratic remains**
  (build still ~96 %).
  **ROOT CAUSE FOUND (perf + XPath instrumentation, 2026-06-21).** `perf record`
  (after `sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1`) on the bench binary shows
  build is ~50 % libxml2 **XPath** (`xmlXPathNextDescendant*` + NodeSet
  `malloc`/`cfree` churn). An env-gated `findnodes` logger
  (`LATEXML_XPATH_LOG`) pinned it: **122,857 `descendant-or-self::*[@xml:id]`
  queries** (90 % of all 136 k findnodes) from `record_node_ids` /
  `unrecord_node_ids` — the math-parser's per-element id-recording round-trips
  (`parser.rs` parse recursion + `rebuild_idstore_from_dom`), each re-scanning a
  subtree → O(N²). **NEGATIVE RESULT:** replacing the XPath with a manual
  first-child/next-sibling Rust walk **REGRESSED** it (37–44 s → >60 s timeout):
  the libxml2 C descendant walk is far cheaper per call than N Rust↔C FFI hops
  through the `libxml`-rs Node wrapper cache (HashMap + Rc per node). So the bulk
  C XPath scan is the *right* mechanism; **the lever is the call COUNT, not the
  per-call cost.** Reverted. **Next = reduce the 122 k id-recording round-trips**
  (the comment at `record_node_ids` notes they are "denser than Perl's" — so
  fewer round-trips is likely *toward* Perl, i.e. faithful). This is structural
  in the id-management / math-parser flow (a sensitive, deferred area) → needs a
  focused design pass + (per the redesign guardrail) sign-off before reshaping
  the parse-time record/unrecord cadence.
  **FIXED 2026-06-21 — no cadence change needed.** A `#[track_caller]` caller
  split pinned 115,131 of the 119k calls to ONE site: `document.rs:~1999`, the
  single-`ltx:text`-child merge calling `record_node_ids(node)` INSIDE the
  per-grandchild move loop → O(G²) re-scans per merge. Hoisted to one post-loop
  call (output-identical: `record_id_with_node` is idempotent for already-correct
  nodes; final id set + sibling document order unchanged). **`math0605199`: wall
  44.9 s → 2.1 s (~20×), build 43.7 s → 1.0 s, errors=0; suite 1466/0/0**
  (commit `335b6b83`). Runs in every conversion → broad latent win, not
  PiCTeX-specific. Remaining witnesses are NOT build-bound after this: re-measured
  `1510.03361` (wall 19.6 s: math_parse 10.3 / build 5.4 / digest 2.2) and
  `1805.03265` tikz-cd (wall 22.4 s: digest 7.8 / math_parse 7.5 / build 5.3) →
  next levers are **math_parse (over-parse, P1 math)** and **digest (pgf, the
  TikZ backlog)**, both in the deferred math-parser area.

  **Build-side sweep CONCLUSION + a report caveat (2026-06-21).** The cortex
  "slow report" runtimes are **fleet-inflated**, not single-paper algorithmic
  cost: re-measured single-paper (ar5iv profile, new binary) the big "slow"
  witnesses are ~10 s, not 90–160 s — `1201.5525` 158 s→**10.6 s** (math_parse
  4.6 / build 4.0, 4999 formulae), `1707.01155` 103 s→**11.5 s**, `1803.07098`
  92 s→**9.3 s**. The 10–15× gap is fleet contention / RSS pressure in the
  72-worker 10k run, NOT a quadratic (build is now linear, ~0.8 ms/formula). So
  the only genuine build *quadratic* was `math0605199` (fixed, 20×); the
  build-side sweep is **exhausted**. Every remaining math-heavy witness is
  **`math_parse`-bound (over-parse)** — the deferred math-parser lever. (Implication
  for future triage: rank optimisation candidates by SINGLE-PAPER telemetry wall,
  not the fleet `runtimes` report, which conflates contention with cost.)
- **`1510.03361` → `math_parse` = 52.8 %** (10.4 s) + `build` 27.2 % (5.4 s);
  2385 formulae, **1.7 GB RSS**. Math-parser-bound — folds into **P1 math
  (over-parse lever)** below; the high RSS + 2385 formulae suggests an ambiguity/
  bocage cluster worth a `LATEXML_PARSE_AUDIT=1` pass.

(Local walls 44.9 s / 19.6 s are well under the cortex 160.7 s / 96.7 s — local is
faster, likely `cortex_worker` RSS-cap/mimalloc-decay/contention during the 10k
sweep; the *phase split* is the actionable signal, not the absolute wall. The
graphics-cluster witnesses, xy/tikz-cd, were not re-profiled — they belong to the
P1 graphics lane by construction.)

#### Next 10 witnesses (ranks 11–20) — the tikz-cd cluster (NEW, open)

The next tier of healthy long-runners is **entirely tikz-cd** (10/10):
`2106.15532` (135.6s), `2108.03453` (113.5s), `1911.09626`, `2202.12168`,
`2107.04417`, `2007.07826`, `1907.04836`, `1805.03265`, `2011.09416`,
`2102.09618`. One cluster, one plan.

**Profile (representative `1805.03265`, ar5iv profile, 0 errors): NOT external
graphics.** WALL 20.8s, **6825 formulae**, `graphics_assets=0` /
`graphics_subprocess=0` (tikz-cd renders natively — no `gs`/`convert`), **1.9 GB
RSS**. Phase split is spread, not dominated: **digest 35.7 % (7.4s) + math_parse
32.7 % (6.8s) + build 23.9 % (5.0s)**. So the cost is driven by the **formula
explosion**: pgf/tikz-cd macro expansion emits thousands of small math formulae
(6825 from one document), and each pays digest (expansion) + math_parse +
build. This is NOT the `graphics` phase (that lane is for raster `xy`-pic /
`\includegraphics`); it's the pure-Rust digest/math/build hot path.

**Levers (compounding — all three phases ride the formula count):**
1. **Reduce the formula count.** 6825 formulae for one tikz-cd doc suggests each
   cell/arrow/label becomes a separate parsed formula. If tikz-cd nodes can share
   a parse or be built without a full per-node math-parse, every phase shrinks
   proportionally. Highest-leverage; needs a look at how the tikz-cd binding emits
   cell content (`latexml_contrib`/pgf bindings).
2. **digest (35.7 %)** → the existing **"TikZ/pgfplots digest backlog"** below
   (lazy `Tokens::Debug` hot path; `Option<SymStr>` from `lookup_value*` to drop
   the `Cow::Borrowed`; pgf `\addplot table` bypass). Same pgf macro layer.
3. **math_parse (32.7 %)** → P1 math over-parse lever; run `LATEXML_PARSE_AUDIT=1`
   on `1805.03265` (6825 formulae, 1.9 GB RSS — likely an ambiguity cluster).
4. **build (23.9 %)** → the `get_first_child` / `find_insertion_point` build work
   (shared with the `math0605199` lane above).

### P1 graphics phase (36.5% of wall) — CLOSED

In-doc dedup (`Plan::Copy`/`Plan::Convert`), persistent on-disk cache,
vector-SVG fast path, vector-PDF auto-detect all landed. Detail moved
to "Graphics phase — completed work" below. Subprocess-only chain
decision recorded in SYNC_STATUS.md (2026-05-12). Output-size
validation set retained as regression fixtures: `0809.3849`,
`0908.3201`, `1003.0368`, `0803.4343`, `0907.4282`.

### P1 digest + build (31.8% of wall, pure-Rust hot path) — CLOSED 2026-05-19

Investigation closed: the residual digest cost is structural to the TeX
semantics, not a Rust-translation accident. **Do not reopen without
new evidence** (e.g. a paper whose digest-time profile diverges from
the pattern recorded below).

> **REOPENED for `build` (not digest), 2026-06-21.** The 2026-05-19 close-out was
> digest-focused. New evidence: `math0605199` spends **97.3 % in the `build`
> phase** (43.7 s; digest only 0.9 %) — a builder hotspot under high node
> fan-out (PiCTeX, 920 formulae), distinct from the digest pattern. The `build`
> phase (XML node construction / insertion-point walk in `latexml_core::document`)
> is an **open** lever; suspected super-linear sibling-append / `find_insertion_point`.
> See "2026-06-21 benchmark" above. Digest itself remains closed.

**Findings under `cargo build --profile bench` + `perf record
-F 999 -e cycles:u` on `2305.06773` (digest-heavy ACM-class fixture,
4.5s of 4.8s wall in digest, witness available under
`/home/deyan/data/430k_noproblem_sandbox/data/arxmliv/2305/2305.06773`).**

Top leaf-frame distribution (~4.7k samples):
* `__mm_movemask_epi8` 363 + `find_inner` 47 + `probe_seq` 47 +
  `get_offset_len_noubcheck` 111 — **all SwissTable hashbrown probe
  code, total ~10% of wall**. Inherent to `state.meaning.get(&token)`
  running once per CS/ACTIVE token in `read_x_token` AND once more in
  `invoke_token` / `lookup_digestable_definition`.
* `state::lookup_meaning` 121 + `with_meaning` 114 — the two state
  accessors. `with_meaning` is borrow-only; `lookup_meaning` clones.
* mimalloc traffic 79 + Token push/write/read 200 — per-token Vec
  growth in the digester output stream.

**Landed this round (all signatures unchanged — function-body wins
only):**
* `Catcode::name_sym` in `lookup_digestable_definition`
  (`f2e23d9570`) — replaces a per-call `arena::pin(cc.name())` (RefCell
  mut on the interner + hashmap probe) with the cached per-call-site
  `pin!()` SymStr. Fires on every non-active-or-cs token.
* 8-site migration `lookup_meaning(t).is_some()` / `.is_none()` →
  `has_meaning(t)` (`3f06ecebd6`). `has_meaning` already existed as a
  clone-free shadow ("keep this in sync with `lookup_meaning`, it is
  copied over for optimization purposes"). Affected `\csname`,
  `\ifdefined`, `\ifcsname`, KeyVal `qname` checks, etc. Wall
  4.81s → 4.68s median on quiet 2305.06773 (≈2.7%).
* `lookup_conditional` (`2b63a1a0a1`) — replaced
  `arena::pin(token.get_executable_name())` (String allocation +
  interner probe) with `Token::pin_cs_name()` (free SymStr access).
  Within noise on this paper, but removes one String + one probe per
  `\if…` dispatch.

**Why we stop here.** The remaining cost is the **TeX-shape
read-then-invoke double probe**: `gullet::read_x_token` looks up a
meaning to decide whether to expand; `stomach::invoke_token` looks it
up again to decide how to invoke. Combining them into one probe would
require restructuring `read_x_token`'s return type to surface the
already-resolved `Stored`. That is an API change driven by perf,
without an ergonomics win, on a gullet API that mirrors the TeX
original by design — **explicitly out of scope**
(user directive, 2026-05-19: "we will not change the API for perf
reasons unless it has a big ergonomics win. The gullet API is coming
from the TeX original to a degree and is mostly fixed, we live with
it"). Caching meanings with invalidation has the same blast radius
(every `assign_meaning` would need to dirty the cache) — also out of
scope.

**Companion lint sweeps this round** (function-body cleanups, also
closed):
* `clippy::redundant_clone` lib targets — 18 sites in core/engine/post
  (`2150d149f9`) + 156 sites in package/contrib (`a66b61e32e`).
* `clippy::or_fun_call` — 57 sites across non-math crates
  (`2544dbf47d`). Concentrated in `Font::get_size().unwrap_or(defsize())`
  and `Dimension::new(0)` / `T_CS!(\\relax)` fallbacks.
* `clippy::needless_collect` — 13 sites (`4b60784177`). Mostly
  `tks.extend(...collect::<Vec<_>>())` patterns in
  `base_parameter_types`.
* `clippy::stable_sort_primitive` — 5 sites (`6f8a412cc8`).
* `clippy::implicit_clone` — 38 sites (`9d181ad95f`).
* `clippy::manual_string_new` + `single_char_pattern` — 10 sites
  (`ae192d3c6c`).

After all of the above, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` was
back to a 14-warning baseline (all in the `latexml_math_parser` ASF
lane). That residual was later cleared by #252 (edition-2024 migration
+ centralized lint enforcement): the workspace is now
`clippy -D warnings`-clean. Tests were 1328/0/0 at the time of this
round (1454/0/0 as of #252).

**Witnesses retained** for any future digest-perf re-examination:
`2305.06773` (ACM-class), `2103.00971` (tikz-heavy, 8.8s digest),
`2208.10851` (mystery digest-heavy 1.5s), `2307.10256` (4.5s digest),
all under `~/data/430k_noproblem_sandbox/data/arxmliv/<yymm>/<id>/`.

**TikZ/pgfplots digest backlog** (from the archived 2026-05-16 callgrind
study, `archive/TIKZ_DIGEST_HOTSPOTS_2026-05-21.md`; numbers stale, ideas
live): (1) lazy-eval the `Tokens::Debug` hot path; (2) return
`Option<SymStr>` from `lookup_value`/`_string`/`_int` to drop the
`Cow::Borrowed` wrapper; (3) a pgfplots `\addplot table` Rust bypass.
SmallVec-backed `Tokens` was tried and regressed (struct bloat) — do not
retry without first shrinking `Token` below 8 bytes.

### P1 math (17.0% of wall)

The 17% over-parse rate is the lever.

- Run `LATEXML_PARSE_AUDIT=1` on telemetry top-5: `0912.4453` (60.6%),
  `1001.5072` (62.5%), `0912.5528` (35.6%), `0908.4292` (46.8%),
  `0909.3532` (62.0%). Rank by total parse time, attempt count,
  repeated token sequence.
- Add exact parsed-math caching where audit shows repeated identical
  normalised token streams in equivalent math context.
- Prefer grammar/semantic pruning for demonstrably-invalid ambiguity
  families: malformed operator chains, impossible double application,
  invalid script targets, empty/mismatched fences.

### P1 failure outliers

The 60s+ tail (5 timeouts + `0903.3465` Xy-pic/token-limit recovery)
needs bounded recovery and clear fatal results, not speed-ups. Treat
separately from the hot-path work.

### P2 allocation/startup cleanup

Profile-driven only. The `*_sym` accessor sweep landed in the
P1 close-out (`Catcode::name_sym` in `lookup_digestable_definition`,
`Token::pin_cs_name` in `lookup_conditional`, etc.). Remaining
candidates — `Stored`/`Tokens` deep copies, package lookup caching,
dump/package loading — land **only after** a slow-tail or sentinel
profile shows them on the hot path. The 2026-05-19 perf sweep

## Build-pipeline optimization roadmap (binary perf + size)

The key release deliverable is a **maximally-performant, smallest**
`latexml_oxide` binary (`maxperf`: opt-3, fat-LTO, codegen-units=1,
panic=abort, stripped, `--no-default-features --features runtime-bindings`).
Beyond the source-level principles above, these are *build-time* levers.
**Prerequisite for all of them:** pin the nightly toolchain
(`rust-toolchain.toml`) so `-Z build-std` / codegen are reproducible
and not at the mercy of nightly churn (we hit a live example: the
`build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort` flag was renamed to a real
`-Cpanic=immediate-abort` strategy on a 2026-06 nightly).

### Binary size composition (measured 2026-06-11)

Where the 46.7 MB maxperf binary's bytes actually are — measured with
`cargo bloat` on a symbol-preserving **no-LTO** build (per-crate numbers are
"where code *originates*"; fat-LTO then redistributes/shrinks, so treat these as
proportions, not exact final bytes).

**Per-crate `.text`:**

| Component | `.text` | What |
|---|---:|---|
| `latexml_package` | 9.2 MiB | LaTeX package/class binding pool — largest single component |
| `[Unknown]` | 13.3 MiB | static C libs (libmarpa, mimalloc, compression) + untagged compiler/std |
| `latexml_engine` | 3.6 MiB | TeX/LaTeX engine binding pool |
| `latexml_contrib` | 2.6 MiB | contributed bindings (+ rhai monomorphizations under LTO) |
| `latexml_core` | 1.6 MiB | core engine |
| `rhai` | 0.7 MiB (true cost +2.23 MB — see below) | embedded script engine |
| `latexml_post` / `latexml_math_parser` / `latexml` (cli) | ~0.5 MiB each | |
| regex stack, `clap`, `marpa`, `kpathsea`/`libxml`/`libxslt` wrappers, `zip` | <0.4 MiB each | deps |

**Per-function:** `[59740 Others] = 26.4 MiB (79% of `.text`)`. The binary is
**~60,000 small functions — one per `\def`/construct — NOT a few fat generics.**
The named large functions are all per-package `load_definitions` registration
shells: `latex_constructs` 1.0 MiB, `amsmath_sty` 313 KiB, `mathtools_sty`
271 KiB, `pgfsys` 253 KiB, … plus two non-binding items: `STDMETRICS`
(807 KiB of font-metric **data**) and `__ModelLoader::build_model` (543 KiB,
RelaxNG schema construction).

**Conclusion — the size is structural, not waste.** It is the cost of porting
LaTeXML's entire macro surface to native code: `package + engine + contrib +
core ≈ 17 MiB` of attributable binding code over ~60k functions. There is **no
single fat generic to de-monomorphize → no cheap size lever.** The only knobs
both fight the project's goals:

1. **Coverage ↔ size** — drop rarely-used package/class ports. Measurable (each
   `*_sty::load_definitions` + its bindings is attributable) but every drop is
   lost compatibility. Not quantified; feature-completeness is the current
   priority, so this is moot unless size becomes a hard requirement.
2. **Data-table binding encoding** — re-represent bindings as runtime-interpreted
   data instead of compiled code. Could cut `.text` dramatically but is a major
   refactor that swaps inlined code for an interpreter — opposes the
   highest-performance goal.

**Decision (2026-06-11): accept the size.** 47 MB is the cost of feature-complete
LaTeX coverage; spend effort on engine-level wins rather than shrinking `.text`.
Confirms the long-standing attribution: the binary is `.text`/binding-pool,
**not** dumps (those gzip to ~870 KB).

Reproduce (symbol-preserving, no-LTO so code stays attributed to its origin crate):

```
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_STRIP=false CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=1 \
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=off \
cargo bloat --release --no-default-features --features runtime-bindings \
  --bin latexml_oxide --crates       # drop --crates, add -n 30 for per-function
```

### Lower-effort levers (measure / decide)

- **`build-std` (panic_abort) — MEASURED, PARKED (2026-06-11).** Hypothesis: a
  std rebuilt with panic=abort would strip the ~1.4 MB of `.eh_frame` unwind
  tables the binary still carries. **The data refuted it:** 46.69 → 46.58 MB
  (−0.11 MB, ~0.2%), with `.eh_frame` **unchanged** (1.240 MB → 1.240 MB). Those
  tables come from the static **C deps** (mimalloc, libmarpa, zstd/bzip2), which
  `-Z build-std` does not touch — NOT from Rust std. Cross-std LTO inlining also
  gave ~nothing (.text 39.75 → 39.64 MB). Not worth the cost (std recompiled
  every build; explicit `--target`; nightly fragility — the
  `panic_immediate_abort` feature was renamed to `-Cpanic=immediate-abort`
  mid-evaluation) for 0.2%. Revisit only if the C-dep `.eh_frame` is addressed
  separately. (Aside: panic=abort already no-ops the `catch_unwind` backstops in
  `pathname.rs` — an accepted CLI trade, unrelated to build-std.)
- **`target-cpu` baseline (decision) — MEASURED 2026-06-21: NO GAIN, keep
  portable `x86-64`.** On the dedicated box (Threadripper 9980X, full AVX-512), a
  396-paper serial sweep showed `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v3` (AVX2) and `=native`
  (AVX-512) both within ±2% of the default baseline (0.978x / 0.985x — i.e.
  noise, marginally slower). The engine is not SIMD-amenable at the hot path
  (branchy catcode/macro dispatch), so ISA widening buys nothing. **Decision:
  keep the conservative `x86-64` default** — runs on any CPU, zero perf penalty.
- **runtime-bindings (rhai) size cost — MEASURED (2026-06-11): +2.23 MB
  (~4.8%).** maxperf with `runtime-bindings` 46.69 MB vs without 44.46 MB
  (`.text` 39.75 vs 37.84 MB → ~1.91 MB of rhai engine code). Shipping it is the
  current decision (customize contributed bindings without recompiling; runtime
  opt-in, so default conversions are unaffected). If the 2.23 MB becomes a
  concern, the clean resolution is two artifacts: a lean default + a `+bindings`
  variant.

## Optimisation acceptance checklist

Before merging a performance change:

1. Release-mode before/after for the standing corpus.
2. One targeted benchmark for the suspected bottleneck.
3. Compare output status and lightweight structural metrics.
4. Report wall, user/sys CPU, max RSS, phase timings.
5. State the expected workload boundary and any fallback path.
6. Keep the change easy to disable if it relies on a heuristic.

For math-parser changes additionally record: parse-count distribution,
total math-parse time, MathML/XMath count, any formulas using a cache
path. Structural math output must be reviewed on math-heavy fixtures
before treating the change as a win.

---

## Standing performance corpus

Run with idle-serial CLI (no `cortex_worker`):

```bash
target/release/latexml_oxide \
  --preload=ar5iv.sty \
  --path=$HOME/git/ar5iv-bindings/bindings \
  --dest=/tmp/out.html --timeout=60 <main.tex>
```

Papers live under `data/10k_sandbox/<id>.zip`; `complex/si.tex` is
in-tree. Helper: `tools/run_perf_corpus.sh`.

### Current baseline (2026-04-30, release)

| Paper | Wall | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| `0906.1883` | 0.76s | aa, birkmult |
| `1011.1955` | 3.88s | math-parser bound |
| `1009.1431` | 2.19s | — |
| `1008.4386` | 3.17s | near-threshold |
| `0909.2656` | 2.56s | — |
| `0911.4739` | 2.74s | JHEP |
| `1005.1610` | 4.37s | post/graphics bound |
| `0803.0466` | 2.30s | aa |
| `complex/si.tex` | 1.28s | siunitx-heavy |

Round-17 baselines saw 5–7s peaks; cumulative wins from `aa3c7c1bb`
(graphics parallelism, –66% on `0911.4739`), 61-site `arena::to_string`
→ `arena::with` sweep, and the 2026-05-12 perf pass closed those
outliers.

### perf profile signatures

- `1011.1955` XML (3.78s, 0.99 CPUs) — single-core math/body
  conversion. Top symbols: `marpa_r_earleme_complete` (7.45%),
  `postdot_items_create` (6.59%), `bv_scan` (2.48%), `marpa_b_new`
  (2.42%), `transitive_closure` (2.08%). With `--nomathparse` the
  Marpa band disappears; remaining samples are libxml wrapper/node
  access and allocator traffic.
- `1005.1610` HTML (2.83s, 3.92 CPUs) — parallel external graphics
  dominates. Top samples in child processes: `gs`, `convert`,
  `png_write_row`, zlib, libc string/alloc. Rust-side Marpa <1% flat.

### Regression trigger

Any corpus entry drifting **> +15%** wall vs last recorded baseline
between commits is a regression signal. Record a new row in a dated
sub-heading; do not overwrite history.

### Graphics phase — completed work

One-line summaries of landed wins; detail lives in code + commit
messages. Keep here as breadcrumbs for regression triage.

- **In-doc coalescing** (2026-05-12, `48fd96ac75`) —
  `Plan::Copy`/`Plan::Convert` key on `(SipHash(content),
  graphicx_options)`. Witness: arXiv:2402.01336 1083 nodes → 17 files.
- **Persistent on-disk cache** (2026-05-16, content-keyed disk cache
  in `latexml_post::graphics`). SHA-256 of
  `source‖page‖density‖target-ext`; storage at
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/latexml-oxide/graphics/<aa>/<hash>.<ext>` plus
  `.dims` sidecar (skips `read_image_dimensions` on hit — Perl
  `LaTeXML.cache` parity). Multi-process safe via
  `<final>.tmp.<pid>.<nanos>` + atomic rename, hardlink-on-read,
  `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` on `.prune.lock` for LRU. Measured: warm
  9.55s → 5.07s on 1909.03909 (21 graphics jobs). Overrides:
  `LATEXML_GRAPHICS_CACHE_OFF=1`, `LATEXML_GRAPHICS_CACHE_DIR=...`,
  `LATEXML_GRAPHICS_CACHE_MAX_MB=N` (default 2048). Tests:
  `graphics_cache::tests::missing_disk_file_triggers_quiet_regeneration`,
  `concurrent_writers_converge_to_one_cache_entry`.
- **Vector-SVG fast path** (round 17, issue #902) — opt-in
  `--graphics-svg-threshold-kb N` bypasses ImageMagick for vector PDFs.
  Witness: `fig8.pdf` (41 KB) 32.4s → 0.3s (~130× / ~111×). Test:
  `latexml_post/tests/integration.rs::test_vector_svg_pathological_convert_case`
  (<5s assertion, skipped without inkscape).
- **Vector-PDF auto-detection** (2026-05-16) — `cortex_worker` `ar5iv`
  profile passes `graphics_svg_threshold_kb: 0`; auto-detect scans PDF
  header (≤256 KB) for `/Subtype /Image` markers and routes to SVG
  when absent and file is ≤500 KB. Overrides:
  `LATEXML_GRAPHICS_VECTOR_AUTO_OFF=1`, or
  `--graphics-svg-threshold-kb N>0` to force the legacy size-only
  gate. Test:
  `latexml_post::graphics::tests::should_try_svg_path_auto_detect`.
- **Sandbox worker default 20 → 8** (2026-05-16,
  `tools/benchmark_canvas.sh`) — graphics-bound papers ran 5–10×
  slower at 20 workers vs single-threaded due to gs/convert/inkscape
  fork-exec contention; at 8 workers per-paper overhead is ≤30% and
  corpus throughput is higher. Override `--workers N` only when the
  canvas is known compute-bound (math/digest-heavy) rather than
  graphics-bound.

### Graphics phase — open perf traps

- **Cache extensionless kpathsea image lookup** — the Perl-parity fix in
  `latexml_core/src/util/image.rs::image_candidates` correctly asks
  kpathsea for `<path>.png` / `<path>.pdf` only after local graphics
  paths miss. Preserve that output behavior, but cache the resolved
  candidate or negative result by `(SOURCEDIRECTORY, path)`: repeated
  references to the same missing extensionless graphic are common in
  arXiv sources, and the kpathsea subprocess backend pays `kpsewhich`
  latency on every uncached miss.

## Mini-benchmark: beat 2× pdflatex on `1910.01256` — MET

2026-05-19: 0.71s release (full post-processing) vs pdflatex idle
~1.11s — 3.13× margin on the 2.22s gate. .text shrink (~3 MiB) from
DEP-15/17/18/19 helped icache locality. Re-measure under the
SYNC_STATUS.md "Acceptance gates" recipe after any large workspace
landing; flag a regression if margin shrinks below 1.5×.

## Math-parser routing — current state (2026-05-18)

The math parser uses **HYBRID routing** by default
(`latexml_math_parser/src/parser.rs::parse_marpa`). One recognizer
pass produces one bocage; routing then branches on Marpa's
`Bocage::ambiguity_metric()`:

- `metric == 1` (unambiguous, 60–87 % of formulae in the
  corpora we've measured) → ordinary `Tree::next()` +
  `Actions::get_tree`. Skips ASF construction entirely.
- `metric >= 2`, bocage and-node count ≤ `HYBRID_AND_NODE_LIMIT`
  (default 500) → ASF traversal (`MathTraverser`). One post-order
  pass; subtree sharing amortizes work.
- `metric >= 2`, bocage exceeds the cap → libmarpa Tree iterator
  on the same already-built bocage with the same six legacy
  convergence caps (`max_unique=10`, `max_consecutive_dupes=16`,
  `max_time=30s`, etc.). Sidesteps the ASF allocation cliff.

Escape hatches: `LATEXML_MARPA_LEGACY=1` forces pure Tree
iteration; `LATEXML_MARPA_ASF_ONLY=1` forces pure ASF (no
hybrid routing, no large-bocage fallback). Both are intended
for divergence debugging only.

The 500-and-node cap exists because downstream consumers
(pragmatics selection, XMath builders) cannot usefully process
more than a handful of distinct parses per formula. Bigger
bocages are treated as a **pipeline-flaw signal**, not a
load-bearing case — candidates for grammar-level category
tightening or earlier action-time pruning. Override with
`LATEXML_MARPA_HYBRID_AND_NODE_LIMIT=N` (`0`/`none` disables).

### Measurements

**Article-2025.tex** (579 formulae, 87.3 % raw-unambiguous,
release+bench, single-thread):

| Mode | Wall (3-run avg) | vs LEGACY |
|---|---:|---:|
| **HYBRID default** | **12.45 s** | **1.01×** |
| `LATEXML_MARPA_LEGACY=1` | 12.32 s | 1.00× |
| `LATEXML_MARPA_ASF_ONLY=1` | 16.80 s | 1.36× |

**100-paper math-bound sample** (top-100 by `phase_math_parse_us`
in wp4 telemetry; release+native+cortex, 8 workers, 180 s timeout,
8 GB ulimit, quiet host, marpa master `0bf24111`):

| Mode | OK / 100 | OOM aborts | Wall (n=98) | Δ vs LEGACY |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LEGACY | 98 | 0 | 2227.1 s | — |
| HYBRID (cap = 500) | 98 | 0 | 2238.6 s | **+0.5 %** |
| HYBRID, no cap (historical) | 79 | 19 | 2955.4 s on n=79 | — |

Per-paper distribution on the cap=500 / n=98 subset: median
0.0 %, mean +1.0 %, 76 of 98 within ±5 %. The cap+fallback fixed
the 19 OOMs the no-cap hybrid produced on this fixture.

### What we tried that didn't move the needle

Settled negative results. Re-litigate only on new evidence.

- `XM::Lexeme(String,_)` → `Rc<str>` + thread-local ASCII cache: ~0 %
  on Article-2025 (kept anyway, removes deep-clone hazards).
- `MathTraverser::ParseTree = Rc<Vec<Option<XM>>>`: ~0 %.
- marpa `HashMap<usize,_>` caches → `Vec<Option<_>>` + slice-children
  API: ~3 %.
- marpa `glades` + `nidset_by_id` → `Vec<Option<_>>`: ~3 %.
- `SmallVec` for `Symch.factorings`: counter data
  (`max_factorings_per_symch=4`, 99.98 % singletons) projected +72 MB
  RAM at 3M-symch workload for ~0 runtime gain — **closed**.

Total Rust-side micro-opt: ~6 % cumulative. HYBRID-routing decision
delivered the ~37 % needed for LEGACY parity.

### Audit env vars

- `LATEXML_MATH_AMBIGUITY_AUDIT=1` — per-formula ambiguity-metric
  counter (raw-unambiguous fraction across the corpus).
- `LATEXML_MARPA_HYBRID_AUDIT_PARITY=1` — runs both ASF and
  Tree-iter on every raw-unambiguous formula; asserts they
  produce equivalent `ParseOutcome` (treats `Empty`/`Rejected`
  as "no parse survived" per `parity_outcomes_compatible`).
- `LATEXML_MARPA_ASF_AUDIT=1` — emits per-formula ASF traversal
  detail (peak alternative count, pruning counter, large-bocage
  fallback fire events with bocage stats).
- `MARPA_ASF_STATS=1` — opt-in marpa-side instrumentation
  (singleton fast path hit rate, glade count, factoring count,
  cache hit/miss). Prints one snapshot per converted document.

### Recorded principles

- **Massive bocage explosions are a pipeline flaw**, not a load
  to absorb. Documented as
  `feedback_ambiguity_explosion_is_a_flaw` in session memory.
  When the cap fires, fix the underlying grammar/action
  ambiguity; do not raise the cap.
- **The residual ASF_ONLY → LEGACY gap is structural.** ASF
  builds a Rust-side glade/Nidset representation that
  Step-iteration skips; the singleton fast path eliminates
  the factoring chain for 99.98 % of glades but the
  glade-bookkeeping fixed overhead persists. Further wins live
  in libmarpa C-side bocage walking (out of scope) or in
  restructuring ASF to skip Nidset/Glade for wholly-unambiguous
  forests (large refactor — HYBRID already achieves this from
  the user's perspective).

### Open items

- **`Pi^N(p,q,…)` ambiguity explosion** (witness 2310.16583):
  formulae produce 2762–3555 and-nodes each. UNKNOWN-as-function
  + paren-comma-list — grammar cannot distinguish `Pi^N(p,q)` as
  function-application vs `Pi^N · (p · q)`. Needs lexer-level
  recognition of capital-Greek-letter-as-function in math
  context, or a semantic pragma that prunes the multiplication
  reading when a comma-separated arg list is present.
- **4 GiB amsthm.sty load OOM**: several wp4 abort papers OOM
  with `memory allocation of 4294967296 bytes failed` (exactly
  2³² bytes) during `amsthm.sty` load. Smells like a signed
  underflow producing `usize::MAX + 1` in a Vec presize. Unrelated
  to the math-parser bocage path.
- **Standing regression watch**: HYBRID vs LEGACY wall on the
  100-paper math-bound sample. Quiet-host baseline: +0.5 %
  delta on n=98 both-OK subset. Re-run on every meaningful
  marpa or math-parser change; flag if HYBRID climbs back
  toward LEGACY parity.

### Reproducing the corpus measurements

```bash
# Build release+native+cortex once:
cargo build --release --bin cortex_worker --features cortex

# HYBRID (default):
tools/benchmark_canvas.sh \
  --input-dir <math-bound-100-zips>/in \
  --output-dir /tmp/out_hybrid \
  --workers 8 --timeout 180

# LEGACY control:
env LATEXML_MARPA_LEGACY=1 tools/benchmark_canvas.sh \
  --input-dir <same input> --output-dir /tmp/out_legacy \
  --workers 8 --timeout 180
```

Capture `results.tsv` (per-paper wall, status, category) and
`telemetry.jsonl` (phase breakdown). Compare on the both-OK
subset.
